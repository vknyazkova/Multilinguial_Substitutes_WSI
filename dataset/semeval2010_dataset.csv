threat.n.12	threat.n	threat	n	Mr. Quinlan , 30 years old , knew he carried a damaged gene , having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was only two months old -- after his mother had suffered the same fate when she was a baby . Because of the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor - suppressor gene , it became possible last January to find out what threat the Quinlan baby faced .

threat.n.16	threat.n	threat	n	Nicaragua 's Ortega postponed until today a decision on whether to end a 19 - month - old cease - fire in the conflict with the Contra rebels .

threat.n.21	threat.n	threat	n	There are still others who do n't mind seeing new crises arise . Environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out mailings describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it . University professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services evaporate when price decontrol destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for `` alternative energy . ''	32
threat.n.22	threat.n	threat	n	In other words , environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few . That tends to tilt the public debate toward `` solutions '' even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency . There is an element of make - work involved .	53
threat.n.23	threat.n	threat	n	If they were really getting insurance against environmental disaster , the price would be cheap . But if there is no impending threat , it can get to be very expensive .	22
threat.n.24	threat.n	threat	n	So , it is n't surprising that consumer - credit delinquencies at banks remain , as the chart shows , reassuringly below some earlier highs -LRB- see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23 , 1989 -RRB- . A severe recession could , of course , raise delinquency rates , but so far the current levels of consumer debt do n't seem to loom as a major threat . In fact , the current weakness in auto buying and department - store sales and the gradual upturn in the household saving rate suggest that consumers , conservative as ever , are already clutching their purses a bit more tightly .	66
threat.n.25	threat.n	threat	n	Pachinko is slightly on the shady side , often linked to the lower ranks of Japan 's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders . Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions , and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe . Also , about 60 % of pachinko parlor owners are Korean , many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents ' organizations , and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan .	36
threat.n.26	threat.n	threat	n	Exports in the first eight months grew only 9 % , to $ 31.48 billion , compared with a growth rate of 25 % a year earlier , according to Chinese customs figures .

threat.n.27	threat.n	threat	n	`` It 's a double - edged sword though , because it is also the most contagious kind of hepatitis .

Matchett , a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc. , Silver Spring , Md .

The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association , a joint industry - government trade group .	65

Democratic counterpart Mitchell , asked to interpret Darman 's threat to make permanent the across - the - board Gramm - Rudman cuts that took effect this week , says , `` I do n't even bother to interpret them . '' But Darman suggests such tensions will dissipate quickly .	22
threat.n.31	threat.n	threat	n	Before July , pro-choice voters could safely make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion . Now , the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension , bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion - rights forces . A recent pro-choice rally in Trenton drew thousands , and in a major reversal , Congress is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest .	19
threat.n.32	threat.n	threat	n	Bush met with South Korean President Roh , who indicated that Seoul plans to further ease trade rules to ensure that its economy becomes as open as the other industrialized nations by the mid-1990s . Bush assured Roh that the U.S. would stand by its security commitments `` as long as there is a threat '' from Communist North Korea . The Bush administration is seeking an understanding with Congress to ease restrictions on U.S. involvement in foreign coups that might result in the death of a country 's leader .	54
threat.n.33	threat.n	threat	n	`` Everybody was afraid of him , '' Mr. Ingersoll says . Mr. Noriega became an even greater threat in 1976 , when U.S. intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from three sergeants working for the U.S. Army 's 470th Military Intelligence Group . The tapes included wiretaps of Gen. Torrijos 's own phone , according to American intelligence officials .	18
threat.n.34	threat.n	threat	n	`` I think the Friday report , combined with the actions of the Fed , weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy , '' said Robert Dederick , chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago .

threat.n.35	threat.n	threat	n	In the 1987 crash , remember , the market was shaken by a Danny Rostenkowski proposal to tax takeovers out of existance .

threat.n.36	threat.n	threat	n	We never intended taking on Sony -- we do n't have the resources . '' Sony answered the empty threat with its real suit . Off and on since then , the companies have skirmished in court .	19
threat.n.37	threat.n	threat	n	If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest . If it does , the large number of right - wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands . The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure .	62
threat.n.38	threat.n	threat	n	"Information and analyses are forwarded to the president for his reference , said Chien , but no one focuses on particular individuals or political parties . The NSB also released a statement stressing that the information it collects is mostly related to matters that affect national security or pose a potential national security threat . As for the accusation that the NSB carries out politically motivated surveillance , the NSB stated that "" gathering intelligence on national affairs "" is one of its legally defined responsibilities ."	53
threat.n.39	threat.n	threat	n	"Regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : This law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market . In the event of "" threats to national stability "" - such as major internal or external events , rapid movements of international capital - the government will be able to draw on an NT$ 500 billion fund . This law has been criticized by academics as a serious distortion of the market mechanism , as putting the policy makers into the position of being market players , and as inevitably creating opportunities for insider trading and the manipulation of the market to the benefit of a privileged few ."	27
threat.n.40	threat.n	threat	n	"Steven Su says that "" we will always have competition from the traditional media like China Times and United Daily News , "" because after all , 104 only works through the Internet . He does not , however , fear the threat from the CTCareer website , which is under the China Times flag , nor is there anything especially novel about the exploitation of both the Internet and magazine formats by the UDN . Last year Acer Peripherals invested in a combination website and magazine , but they exhausted their capital within three months ."	42
threat.n.41	threat.n	threat	n	"Last December , at a seminar at the Armed Forces University entitled "" Transmillennial National Security and Military Strategy , "" Lien delivered an address entitled "" National Defense Strategy and Construction in the New Century . "" He suggested that Taiwan will have to develop long-range missiles to counter the mainland Chinese military threat . While "" effective deterrence "" would remain the cornerstone of strategy , it should no longer be passive , said Lien , but "" pro-active . """	54
threat.n.42	threat.n	threat	n	Lin Cheng-yi , a research fellow at the Institute of European and American Affairs at the Academia Sinica , says that the successful testing by mainland China of missiles in 1996 has altered the lines of strategic thought on both sides of the strait . Guided missiles have replaced aircraft as the major threat to Taiwan . In recent years mainland China has also constructed short-range surface - to - surface missile bases along its Southeast Coast which are specifically targeted at Taiwan .	53
threat.n.43	threat.n	threat	n	Although this prediction is not necessarily accurate , Taiwan should work to maintain its edge so as to guarantee peace through strength . Fuh Wei-ku offers the following analysis : Currently the PRC weapons which pose the greatest threat to Taiwan are Sukhoi aircraft , M-class missiles , and cruise missiles . Of these , the aircraft are already strategically of the second rank , but Taiwan must be alert to the missiles .	38
threat.n.44	threat.n	threat	n	If Taiwan were to develop long-range missiles , this would change Taiwan 's defensive posture , and alter the Taiwan - US military division of labor . There is another possibility for Taiwan in defending against the threat of missiles from the PRC . Besides building offensive systems , Taiwan could also join the US Theater Missile Defense -LRB- TMD -RRB- plan .	37
threat.n.45	threat.n	threat	n	Moreover , this is also necessary from the point of view of public opinion . In an analysis of the threat that guided missiles pose to morale in Taiwan , ROC Minister of Defense Tang Fei points out that perhaps for some countries a missile attack would have little impact . But in Taiwan , where resources are concentrated , missiles pose a serious threat to electrical power and petroleum production , to transportation -LRB- harbors , highways , airports , railroads -RRB- , and to factories .	20
threat.n.46	threat.n	threat	n	In an analysis of the threat that guided missiles pose to morale in Taiwan , ROC Minister of Defense Tang Fei points out that perhaps for some countries a missile attack would have little impact . But in Taiwan , where resources are concentrated , missiles pose a serious threat to electrical power and petroleum production , to transportation -LRB- harbors , highways , airports , railroads -RRB- , and to factories . More importantly , he says , the citizens of Taiwan are not psychologically prepared .	49
threat.n.47	threat.n	threat	n	For example , South Korea has developed its own SSMs , Singapore has airborne refueling capability , and Israel has a strategy of keeping the fighting outside its borders as much as possible . Of course , different countries are in different situations , and the external threats faced by these countries are not comparable to the cross-strait situation . PRC military affairs expert Alex Kao concludes that although the idea of taking a war beyond Taiwan is worth consideration , it would only be really useful if it could be adopted into the national security structure and done in an integrated and comprehensive way .	47
threat.n.48	threat.n	threat	n	""" Soft kill "" refers to computer viruses and electronic interference to destroy the enemy 's computer systems , and thereby to neutralize the enemy 's military capability in a bloodless manner . Some people see in third-wave warfare an opportunity to seize a decisive advantage in the face of a future armed threat from mainland China . To be sure , because of the domestic development of the electronics industry in Taiwan , the ROC has a certain advantage ."	53
threat.n.49	threat.n	threat	n	The outcome of Taiwan 's year 2000 presidential election is not the victory of an individual or a political party . It is a victory of the people as well as a victory for democracy , because we have , while attracting global attention , transcended fear , threats and oppression and bravely risen to our feet together . Taiwan stands up , demonstrating a firm insistence on reason and a sturdy faith in democracy .	48
threat.n.50	threat.n	threat	n	""" This is because state enterprises pressure the government with appeals about their right to survival , "" Yeh says . When foreign firms in the mainland are confronted with threats to their safety and property , "" Hong Kong can count on the cooperation of the government , US and Japanese businesses can turn to their ambassadors , but what can Taiwan firms do ? "" asks Yeh . In Dongguan they can help each other ."	30
threat.n.51	threat.n	threat	n	Rural society has disintegrated , and traditional industrial sectors have withered , as newly rising electronics and information industries have appeared one after another . These rapid changes have brought the threat of unemployment or early retirement to many individuals . In order to cope with the increasing uncertainty of life , it is necessary for people to build up a nest egg .	31
threat.n.52	threat.n	threat	n	"If Chen Shui-bian is elected , this would be Taiwan 's first case of a peaceful transfer of power from one party to another . DPP legislator Chang Chun-hung says that the process of democratization in Taiwan during Lee Teng-hui 's administration has been smooth and tranquil , but beneath the surface there lurks a major threat to democracy : the KMT 's "" black gold politics . "" Explains Chang : The DPP has never had the chance to be the ruling party , and therefore has never been in a position to fulfill its function of restraining the KMT ."	56
threat.n.53	threat.n	threat	n	"The effects may prove to be far - reaching . Chang Chun-hung adds that negative election tactics , which after all may be seen in any democratic country , are not - bad as they are - the biggest threat . He says Taiwan voters should most be on the lookout for the "" one of us "" effect ."	39
threat.n.54	threat.n	threat	n	Perhaps the millennium year was a decisive one for the trees , for the Executive Yuan allocated new funds to the VACRS so that it no longer needs to cut down trees to bolster its finances , and also approved a plan to set up a national park . But so - called ecotourism is now emerging as another threat to the trees ' survival . To assure the livelihood of the local Atayal aborigines of Chilan , when the cypress national park is set up consideration will have to be given to how to balance the need to protect the forests with the demand for sustainable tourism .	59

threat.n.126	threat.n	threat	n	John Moore , a former government intelligence analyst says it was a mistake for those operations to move to Aden . I tend to fault the US policy that brought the refueling activity from Djibouti to Aden , given the abundance of threat indicators in the country , that being Yemen . It has been known for some time that various groups , either Palestinians , North African groups , some of Bin Laden 's men actively reside in Yemen , so again , I really question the wisdom of that policy .	42
threat.n.127	threat.n	threat	n	The wisdom of trying to establish ties with the Yemeni government , I can certainly see the logic behind that . Again my specific question comes in to why they moved the refueling activity from Djibouti to Aden , given the level of threat in the country . It is one thing to build relationships , it is another thing to put actually your men and women on the front line , when they did n't have to be there .	43

One chapter opens : `` World War II was not one of France 's glorious moments .

Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar , precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation , dealers say . Silver , however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum .	61

After losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor 's race , he has prepared himself methodically for this moment , including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions . `` If you 're going to be consistent and say it is a constitutionally protected right , '' he asks , `` how are you going to say an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not ?

moment.n.21	moment.n	moment	n	Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona . The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB- and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old - fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself . But too often , these routines lack spark because this sitcom , like all sitcoms , is timid about confronting Mr. Mason 's stock in trade - ethnic differences .	18
moment.n.22	moment.n	moment	n	During last week 's maneuverings on the deficit - cutting bill and the capital - gains issue , there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds . At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit - reduction legislation , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it .

But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended .

body.n.102	body.n	body	n	Yeah /. So so I think -- I think this this may help us this recent revelation uh about a player who had everything to lose but who still apparently put steroids in his body /. You know he had the Hall of Fame and the three thousand hits and the endorsements and uh really the the respect and admiration of the entire country /.	34
body.n.103	body.n	body	n	So he says he saw some men drive up in a white pickup truck men that he says he later recognized to be the three suspects in this case /. He says they took what looked like a body out of the back of the pickup truck /. It was wrapped up in a bag /.	38

body.n.114	body.n	body	n	To protect themselves prosecutors have add- added two second degree murder charges that do not require a sex crime to have taken place /. Earlier in the day Police Commissioner Ray Kelly and Brooklyn District Attorney Joe Hines laid out some of the evidence in the case in addition Dan to what we 'd heard before Which was the cops had cell phone records placing Mr. Littlejohn in the area where Imette 's body was found Witnesses saying that Mr. Littlejohn left the Falls bar with Imette And blood of Mr. Littlejohn 's apparently on the ties that were bo- -- that were binding together Imette 's hands /.

From Mr. Littlejohn 's diverse wardrobe apparently cops say they found hairs matching two of his jackets on the tape that was wrapping Imette 's face and also on the blanket that was wrapping her body /. You you you say diverse wardrobe /.	45
body.n.116	body.n	body	n	There was a rabbit coat and a mink coat /. And fibers from those coats were apparently found on both the tape as I said and also on the blanket that her body was found in /. That 's the extent at this point of the evidence that police say they have . Although they were -- they they pointed out that they 've gone through forensically twenty percent of the evidence that they have collected /.	32
body.n.117	body.n	body	n	A ~DNA match was made with Littlejohn 's blood on the plastic ties that bound her hands /. Red polyester rug fibers from carpeting in Littlejohn 's residence along with brown mink hair from a jacket in his residence and blue rabbit hair from a jacket collar in his residence were consistent with rug fibers mink and rabbit hair that were found on the tapes used on Imette 's head in the blanket in which her body was found and in the Winstar van used by Littlejohn /. I 'm a likely suspect because I have a criminal background and I was n't supposed to be there working /.	76
body.n.118	body.n	body	n	I 'm a likely suspect because I have a criminal background and I was n't supposed to be there working /.

Finally there are no witnesses or other evidence to support Littlejohn 's claim that he visited his mother in a nursing home on the day Imette was killed /.	57
body.n.121	body.n	body	n	No but listen /. If the -- if the theory is that she was raped and killed why is n't Littlejohn 's ~DNA all over her body /? We have no semen /.	26
body.n.122	body.n	body	n	but you do n't need to pr- -- you do n't need to prove that there was semen /. You know you do n't need to prove that there was any kind of mark left on her body /. Not according to this indictment /.	37

body.n.153	body.n	body	n	And yet another reason why that bone could be a key link , there are reports that have surfaced that in terms of the female remains that were found the skeleton was not completely intact . Now this case is also taking on a rather , we should say , almost a TV episodic forensic pathology angle because they 're going to bring in an expert on what 's called alufating decay , and basically this person is going to come in here and look at the body . This is in the damage aspect of it .	87
body.n.154	body.n	body	n	This is in the damage aspect of it .

body.n.157	body.n	body	n	They believe -- police say that is where Scott Peterson told them that he did go fishing the day that Laci Peterson did disappear . Now , a source close to the investigation has told me that what they are really looking for are concrete anchors or weights which may have parts of Laci Peterson 's body or clothing or something attached to it , that they did discover a concrete weight in Scott Peterson 's warehouse . If it matched , that would be something that could link Scott Peterson -- it would be like a smoking gun in this case .	56

body.n.169	body.n	body	n	Do they actually enter the submarine ? How do they go about extracting the bodies of the submariners ? Well , they wo n't enter straight away .	14
body.n.170	body.n	body	n	It is a very dangerous operation . Then they may send in a television camera , a remote - controled television camera to have a look around and see what the conditions are like , and then , based upon the weather conditions , a decision will be made whether to go inside and begin the search for bodies . The weather is so vital because if the weather is stormy , if the winds are strong , then it makes it extremely dangerous for the Russian divers who will be going inside .	58
body.n.171	body.n	body	n	Given the fact that there are so many dangers and that these divers are risking their own lives , I wonder if there is consideration given to the fact that this may not be really worth it . I mean have some suggested just leaving the sailors ' bodies there and respecting the site as a grave ? Yes , I have to say that more and more people in Russia are suggesting that this operation is not worth risking the lives of more people , risking the lives of the deep - sea divers , and in fact , many of the relatives of the crewmembers who died in this tragedy , they too are saying that the operation should be cancelled .	48
body.n.172	body.n	body	n	Last month , in accordance with Russian Orthodox tradition , a remembrance class was held 40 days after the death of 118 seamen aboard the Kursk . All over the country bearded priests spread out a roll call of the crewmembers , but even the clouds of incense could not hide the two main controversies following the accident - what caused it and what to do with the submarine and the bodies of the crew . President Vladimir Putin promised the families that the bodies will be recovered and Sir Gay Evanell , the head of the powerful Security Council says the promise still stands .	71

We are going to see through this unique operation .	57
body.n.174	body.n	body	n	No one has ever done anything like it before , and we do realize that it is very risky , both when it comes to physical dangers for the divers , and to the psychological stress depending on what we find there . But not everyone thinks recovering the bodies is a good idea . Naval Captain Biltera Pedro says it 's against tradition that sailors have respected for centuries and could also cause great grief .	49
body.n.175	body.n	body	n	Naval Captain Biltera Pedro says it 's against tradition that sailors have respected for centuries and could also cause great grief . He says , `` just imagine the tragedy of those families when some bodies are retrieved and others are n't . '' Russia had a similar case way back in 1970s says Pedro , when just one body was recovered .	35
body.n.176	body.n	body	n	He says , `` just imagine the tragedy of those families when some bodies are retrieved and others are n't . '' Russia had a similar case way back in 1970s says Pedro , when just one body was recovered . The Fleet Commander then decided to have even that one body handed back to the sea where the submarine went down says Pedro .	37
body.n.177	body.n	body	n	Russia had a similar case way back in 1970s says Pedro , when just one body was recovered . The Fleet Commander then decided to have even that one body handed back to the sea where the submarine went down says Pedro . And it 's not just about the tradition in the past , but the future as well argues Alexe Budnev from the Veterans Club of the Russian Fleet .	29
body.n.178	body.n	body	n	For me , it 's rather cynical attempt to shut them up . With so many secrets linked to the Kursk , Russia 's most advanced nuclear submarine , the full truth may never emerge , even if the bodies and the boat eventually do . For The World this is Nenad Sebek in Moscow .	39
body.n.179	body.n	body	n	In the back room where the funeral followed , police investigators survey the corpse of the beautiful 16 - year - old girl killed by suspected guerillas . They turned and twisted her limp body to inspect the bullet wounds . These men have seen all types of victims , students , housewives , taxi drivers and businessmen among others , but this one hits the police hard because of her age .	34
body.n.180	body.n	body	n	Well , yes mostly European judicial systems do have a form of the Supreme Court . However , for example , in France the strict machinery of justice is separated from the constitutional court , which is a separate body , but yes there also the members are appointed by the President and therefore there also , the members of the Coseque Constitutionalle are somewhat open to criticism that the decisions are often more motivated by politics than they are by the law . However , I think that the image that we Europeans had , of the American system and especially of the US Supreme Court , was that those justices were above politics and , I think , that is also one of the bad surprises that this election is reserving to us Europeans is that finally your system is not as perfect as we were led to believe .	39
body.n.181	body.n	body	n	He says there are two main reasons for raising the Kursk . Obviously the first one is to recover the bodies that remain . There are still the bodies of more than 100 sailors trapped in the vessel since it sank in the Barents Sea in August of last year .	20
body.n.182	body.n	body	n	Obviously the first one is to recover the bodies that remain . There are still the bodies of more than 100 sailors trapped in the vessel since it sank in the Barents Sea in August of last year .

class.n.8	class.n	class	n	"The local officials said that , the previous situation whereby large numbers of import and export goods of Jiangxi province had to be re-shipped through the Guangzhou port and the Shanghai port in the form of sparse packaging will be changed completely . During the early days , a 5000 ton class container dock had already been built in Jiujiang port in the north of Jiangxi . The Nanchang port became another "" access to the sea "" in Jiangxi besides the Jiujiang port ."	51
class.n.9	class.n	class	n	US capital corporations have become the corporations with the most profits among Tianjin 's foreign merchant investment corporations . This was pointed out today by Tianjin 's vice-Mayor , Disheng Ye , when he made a thematic investment report for the '97 MBA class international on - site observation group of the US New York University Stone Business Administration Institute .

class.n.11	class.n	class	n	After the policy was formally announced for the Pudong Lujiazui Financial Trade District to allow foreign capital banks to operate RMB business , more than 40 foreign capital banks and financial institutions have submitted applications to establish branches in Pudong . When selecting locations in Lujiazui , some foreign financial institutions do not mind the real estate prices , but focus more on whether the class of the building is compatible with the standing of the company . The Franklin Templeton Company , whose headquarters are in California , USA , and which has registered capital of 130 billion US dollars all around the world , decided to establish its local China headquarters in Pudong .	65

class.n.19	class.n	class	n	Today , we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and , then , propel it into a deadly state . '' Scientists call the new class of genes tumor - suppressors , or simply anti-cancer genes . When functioning normally , they make proteins that hold a cell 's growth in check .	33
class.n.20	class.n	class	n	`` It impresses on ordinary , young Filipinos that there 's nothing to feel inferior about in using their own language , '' says Randy David , a sociologist and host of a popular television talk show . `` When we started the program six years ago , the use of Filipino was deemed unwise by the predominantly middle class , '' says Lydia Brown , the program 's creator . Now , she says , `` it 's no longer an issue . ''	59
class.n.21	class.n	class	n	But while better - off Filipinos are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as English , they are often slow to reveal that they are prejudiced against Filipino , say advocates of the native language . `` For the middle and upper - middle class -LCB- Filipino -RCB- is declasse , '' says Bien Lumbera , a Philippine - studies professor at Quezon City 's University of the Philippines . There 's also resentment .	49
class.n.22	class.n	class	n	What tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the Philippines . It is entrenched in the country 's colonial bonds to the U.S. , in Philippine class structure , in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography . As they did when the Philippines was a colony of the U.S. , teachers for the most part teach in English , even though it is a foreign language for most Philippine children .	28
class.n.23	class.n	class	n	Japan has climbed up from the ashes of World War II and a gross national product of about $ 800 per capita to reach the heavyweight class among industrialized nations . Now this remarkable economic growth seems to be coming to an end because the government has not converted itself into a modern , democratic , `` developed nation '' mode of operation .	26
class.n.24	class.n	class	n	That system has worked . The standard of living has increased steadily over the past 40 years ; more than 90 % of the people consider themselves middle class . The people have given their leading and only credible political party , the Liberal Democratic Party , clear and uninterrupted power for those 40 years .	28
class.n.25	class.n	class	n	-LRB- Braniff declined -RRB- . When I asked American Airlines for its side of the story for use in my MBA class , where I teach business ethics , it did not respond . Perhaps the ethics of an industry 's leader filters down and is one of the factors that ultimately shapes consumer trust in that industry .	21
class.n.26	class.n	class	n	Instead of castling , a standard measure to safeguard the king , D.T. made a second - rate rook maneuver at move 13 ; then it put a knight offside on move 16 . `` Only two classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human players , and computers , '' said Edmar Mednis , the expert commentator for the match , which was attended by hundreds of chess fans . By move 21 , D.T. had fallen into a deep positional trap .	37
class.n.27	class.n	class	n	The reason is simple : Education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal . Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils -- though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons . The new money flows into the already top - heavy administrative structure , which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers .	30
class.n.28	class.n	class	n	Interest on the bonds will be treated as a preference item in calculating the federal alternative minimum tax that may be imposed on certain investors . Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. -- $ 250 million of Remic mortgage securities being offered in 11 classes by Morgan Stanley . The offering , Series 107 , is backed by Freddie Mac 15 - year , 9 % securities , and brings Freddie Mac 's 1989 Remic issuance to $ 32.8 billion and its total volume to $ 46.8 billion since the program began in February 1988 .	43

class.n.32	class.n	class	n	`` This has been a 15 - pound earthquake for me , '' said resident Joan O'Shea , who works in an acupuncturist 's office . She and some friends are considering offering earthquake victims free yoga classes and `` aroma therapy '' -- massages with scented oils . She finds the response of Marina residents -- primarily yuppies and elderly people -- to the devastation of their homes `` incredible .	37
class.n.33	class.n	class	n	The characters confront a world in which it seems increasingly difficult to find a `` middle way '' between the extremes of success and failure , wealth and poverty . In making Malcolm and Nora such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation , Ms. Zeidner has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters . The humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts -LRB- even the characters ' own -RRB- are likely to bleed for the plight of health - food eaters .	41
class.n.34	class.n	class	n	But readers may well feel the pangs of recognition . In any case , the foundering middle classes are n't the only ones in trouble -- or whose troubles provide material for fiction . `` Rascal Money '' -LRB- Contemporary Books , 412 pages , $ 17.95 -RRB- , a novel by consultant and business analyst Joseph R. Garber , tells the story of an innovative , well - run , widely respected computer manufacturing company called PegaSys as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by AIW , a much smaller corporation that is so incompetently managed as to constitute a standing joke in the business world .	17
class.n.35	class.n	class	n	The spokesman says the `` glitch '' in the statute is `` the worst kind of Catch - 22 . '' Many Law School Grads Find Classes Never End RECENT LAW school graduates are starting jobs with law firms this fall -- and heading back to class .	26
class.n.36	class.n	class	n	Many Law School Grads Find Classes Never End RECENT LAW school graduates are starting jobs with law firms this fall -- and heading back to class . Bar associations and consultants are offering more programs to teach associates all they need to know about law but did n't learn in law school .	25
class.n.37	class.n	class	n	In the past , associates learned the basics from senior lawyers who acted as mentors . But these days , large firms hire as many as 30 new associates a year , and it 's impossible to personally train everyone , says Joel Henning of Hildebrandt Inc. , a consulting firm that runs training classes . The Hildebrandt course enables students to brush up on negotiation skills by role playing in simulated deals .	54
class.n.38	class.n	class	n	The plan is talking about applicants admitted , not students who enroll . Since the `` yield '' from this top slice of applicants is relatively low , boosting admits from 40 % to 50 % will boost registrants from about 31 % to 38 % of the class . In addition , perhaps 5 % of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials `` narrowly missed '' gaining them admission in the first category .	48
class.n.39	class.n	class	n	Who will take over these places ? The plan creates a new category of students from `` socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds , '' a concept not yet defined , and gives them about 10 % of the class . One of the plan 's authors has defended the `` socioeconomic disadvantage '' category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative - action preferences based on race .	36
class.n.40	class.n	class	n	Travelers up to age 99 get a percentage discount matching their age . And centenarians fly free in first class . Next month , Northwest Airlines says , a 108 - year - old Lansing , Mich. , woman is taking it up on the offer to fly with her 72 - year - old son to Tampa , Fla .	19
class.n.41	class.n	class	n	Average household income for the sample was $ 194,000 , and average net assets were reported as $ 775,000 . The goal was to learn about one of today 's fastest - growing income groups , the upper - middle class . Although they represent only 2 % of the population , they control nearly one - third of discretionary income .	40
class.n.42	class.n	class	n	Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. -- $ 500 million of Remic mortgage securities offered in 13 classes by Prudential - Bache Securities Inc .

class.n.43	class.n	class	n	The offering , Series 102 , backed by Freddie Mac 8 1/2 % securities with a weighted average remaining term to maturity of 28.4 years , was priced before the market 's afternoon surge . Among classes for which details were available , yields ranged from 8.78 % , or 75 basis points over two - year Treasury securities , to 10.05 % , or 200 basis points over 10 - year Treasurys . Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. --	36
class.n.44	class.n	class	n	The collateral is being sold by a thrift institution . The principal - only securities will be repackaged by BT Securities into a Freddie Mac Remic , Series 103 , that will have six classes . The interest - only securities will be sold separately by BT Securities .	34
class.n.45	class.n	class	n	But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior . It should also encourage service -- preferably by all classes and all ages . Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the U.S. , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing .	26
class.n.46	class.n	class	n	Yes , if targeted . People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve , but there are many ways for middle - class kids , and their elders , to serve at little public cost . They can volunteer at any of thousands of non-profit institutions , or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers .	11
class.n.47	class.n	class	n	This year they include Michael Kuan , Andrew Hsia , and Jason Blatt . The course includes classes on political broadcasting , international broadcasting information / propaganda strategies , and digital television broadcast development , as well as visits to the Central Broadcasting Corporation , Taiwan Television Corporation , Eastern TV , and other media outlets . Generally speaking , the participants are very interested in Taiwan 's high-tech industries and products .	17
class.n.48	class.n	class	n	Among the ROC 's medals , the gold - the first ever for Taiwan - was won by Chiang Chih-chung . With a throw of 57.28 meters , Chiang shattered the world record for the javelin in the F12 visually - impaired class . Chiang , a member of the Bunun indigenous people , received a traditional hero 's welcome home from the Bunun of Sanmin Rural Township in Kaohsiung County .	42

class.n.55	class.n	class	n	The Dongguan city government has leased an 86,000 - square - meter site to the association at an extremely low price , and the school 's cornerstone was laid last year in a ceremony held on 3 November .

class.n.57	class.n	class	n	"Most of its teaching materials are very similar to those used in Taiwan 's elementary schools , and of the 15 or so teachers there , three are from Taiwan . The big difference is that classes are taught in both Chinese and English because the Taiwanese parents are very interested in seeing that their children learn English well . According to Huang Su , executive director of Little Oxford , "" A lot of parents keep after me to make sure that the children 's education is exactly like the regular system in Taiwan , but I have to remind them that once you 've left in Taiwan , you 're not regular any longer . """	36

class.n.59	class.n	class	n	"The best of both worlds Neighboring places heavily influenced by "" Asian values , "" such as Japan , Korea and Hong Kong , have a strong sense of how important it is to belong to "" the educated class , "" just as we do here . As Tang Mei-ying points out , this means that parents expect their children to perform outstandingly well at school ."	39
class.n.60	class.n	class	n	The importance that parents attach to education is of course a strong point for Taiwan , but one drawback of this is that parents often set their expectations too high . At an age when most kids in the West are still playing every day , our children have already started shuttling about among supplementary schools for classes in English , computers , abacus and art . Tang explains that although Western children seem to be playing about , they are also finding out what interests them , and they have plenty of chances to change direction .	57
class.n.61	class.n	class	n	And a child who is free to make his own choices does n't automatically turn into a delinquent . Experimental classes giving pupils the chance for self-motivated study are now being offered in some schools in Taiwan , and the results show that these children are happier and more positive . Joyce Yen Feng , executive director of the Child Welfare League Foundation , an organization dedicated to promoting the rights of children , says that there does n't have to be a contradiction between granting children their rights and maintaining Asian values .	20

class.n.66	class.n	class	n	Even more interestingly , the teacher makes up lyrics about the river preservation campaign and sets them to traditional folk melodies , thus melding the old and the new . In the class on local history , the participants themselves do all the talking . They exchange stories about the past and talk about places whose names no longer even appear on the maps .	32

Cathay also is moving some of its labor - intensive data - processing operations outside Hong Kong .	68
flight.n.14	flight.n	flight	n	Cathay is working to promote Hong Kong as a destination worth visiting on its own merits , rather than just a stopover .

Aer Rianta now manages duty - free sales on all Aeroflot international flights out of Moscow . Duty - free shops in Leningrad 's Pulkova Airport opened in July , and hard - currency shops in Leningrad hotels and on the Soviet - Finnish frontier are coming soon .	42
flight.n.24	flight.n	flight	n	Aeroflot 's international fleet of 285 planes is being repainted and refurbished at Shannon Airport . Thanks to a new air - traffic agreement and the ability of Irish travel agents to issue Aeroflot tickets , tourists here are taking advantage of Aeroflot 's reasonable prices to board flights in Shannon for holidays in Havana , Kingston and Mexico City . The round - trip fare to Havana is 410 Irish punts -LRB- $ 578 -RRB- .	48
flight.n.25	flight.n	flight	n	Advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a Shannon stop unnecessary for most Western air fleets , but Aeroflot still flies inefficient Ilyushins that ca n't make it from Moscow to Managua on one hop . As a result , Ireland did n't spurn the Soviets after they shot down a Korean Air Lines jetliner over the Sea of Japan in 1983 , though it suspended direct Moscow - Shannon flights for two months . In fact , Aer Lingus started ferrying Russians from Shannon to New York when Washington stripped Aeroflot of its U.S. landing rights .	72

margin.n.1	margin.n	margin	n	China 's down and down products industry started its rapid development in the mid '80s . The entire industry makes use of China 's resources and manpower advantage , and additionally stresses introducing advanced foreign technology and equipment , thus increasing production volume and quality by a large margin .

The second is China 's large margin reduction of tariffs in 1996 which will further improve its investment environment and attract more foreign businessmen to come to invest . The analysis shows that , with the situation of greater opportunity and extremely favorable international situations , China 's economic development still faces severe challenges this year .	68

margin.n.24	margin.n	margin	n	3 -RRB- Republican congressional representatives , because of their belief in a minimalist state , are less willing to engage in local benefit - seeking than are Democratic members of Congress . If these assumptions hold , voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive , at the margin , to lean Democratic . If they put a Republican into office , not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from `` bringing home the bacon '' to their respective constituencies .	60

Given that he has already controlled a majority of the National Assembly , it is very likely that the law will be passed and the general feeling is that there is a hurry in approving the legislation because the President seems to feel that he is running out of time with the popular support he has gotten ever since 1998 . Cuniket says , there has been a lot of public pressure on Chavez to live up to his many campaign promises , such as distributing land and wealth more equally among Venezuelans .	73

And in most cases , a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is , in effect , paying the salesman 's commission as well ; investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years , largely because of this . So view permanent insurance for what it is -- a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment .	69
commission.n.18	commission.n	commission	n	I 'm more favorably impressed by `` no - load life , '' even though it turns out to be low - load life . Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen ; there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial `` setup '' charges -- but I figure that the lack of commission and of `` surrender fees '' for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot . I compared one universal policy for $ 130,000 face amount from such an insurer , American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln , Neb. , with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. , which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen .	40

office.n.57	office.n	office	n	It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause -LRB- technically a limitation on legislative power -RRB- could be read as placing the president on Congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress . As it went to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money .

office.n.124	office.n	office	n	In fact , sophisticated big - bucks boiler - room scams are known generically among law - enforcement types as `` Newport Beach '' operations . That contrasts with the penny - ante sales of things such as pen - and - pencil sets and office supplies that are known as `` Hollywood '' scams . Newport Beach telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil - leasing deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot .	45
office.n.125	office.n	office	n	Newport Beach operations differ from the Hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars . Traditionally , boiler rooms operate on the cheap , since few , if any , customers ever visit their offices .

office.n.127	office.n	office	n	San Franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula , not because IRS agents envy their life styles . Many openings for mass cheating , such as questionable tax shelters and home offices , have gaped so broadly that Congress has passed stringent laws to close them . Deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied by appraisals .	43
office.n.128	office.n	office	n	In most cases , the IRS says , these projects are local or regional , rather than national , and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among , say , factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses . The national office currently has 21 noncriminal audit projects , according to Marshall V. Washburn , deputy assistant commissioner for examination . Auditors involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to jail , but they can make life miserable in other ways -- for one , by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence , failure to file a return , and the like .	61
office.n.129	office.n	office	n	Between 1978 and 1987 , for instance , SH Oil in Winter Haven , Fla. , sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents , while turning away numerous other eager investors . The owner of the company , Stephen Smith , who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges , confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential , according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office . Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed , the suit alleged .	98

When he visited the company 's office , he says , it had `` all the trappings of legitimacy .

office.n.131	office.n	office	n	-LRB- Donald Trinen , an attorney for the penny - brokerage firm , denies the fraud allegations and says the Lyneses were fully apprised that they were pursuing a high - risk investment . -RRB- `` It 's not uncommon for these guys to send pictures of themselves or their families to ingratiate themselves to their clients , '' says Terree Bowers , chief of the major - frauds section of the U.S. attorney 's office in Los Angeles . `` We 've seen cases where salesmen will affect the accent of the region of the country they are calling .	75
office.n.132	office.n	office	n	The issue : Is the planner putting his clients into the best investments , or the ones that garner the biggest commissions ? In 1986 the New York attorney general 's office got an order from a state court in Albany shutting down First Meridian Corp. , an Albany financial - planning firm that had invested $ 55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors . In its notice of action , the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into `` balanced '' investment portfolios ; instead , the attorney general alleged , the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high - risk investments in paintings , coins and Florida condos .	31
office.n.133	office.n	office	n	1 -RRB- Voters can `` buy '' one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest . 2 -RRB- Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues -LRB- programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and / or confers benefits on the population at large -RRB- and attending to local issues -LRB- constituency service and pork barrel -RRB- . 3 -RRB- Republican congressional representatives , because of their belief in a minimalist state , are less willing to engage in local benefit - seeking than are Democratic members of Congress .	77
office.n.134	office.n	office	n	If these assumptions hold , voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive , at the margin , to lean Democratic . If they put a Republican into office , not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from `` bringing home the bacon '' to their respective constituencies . Each legislator , after all , is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making .	40
office.n.135	office.n	office	n	Second , it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency . Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit - seeking have lower security in office . For example , first - term members of the House , once the most vulnerable of incumbents , have become virtually immune to defeat .	76
office.n.136	office.n	office	n	For example , first - term members of the House , once the most vulnerable of incumbents , have become virtually immune to defeat . The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982 . Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the Reagan revolution -- in national policy making , they were more vulnerable to defeat .	44
office.n.137	office.n	office	n	Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the Reagan revolution -- in national policy making , they were more vulnerable to defeat . Fourth , the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office . Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent .	48
office.n.138	office.n	office	n	Fifth , the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South . To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies , voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office . Finally , the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House .	76
office.n.139	office.n	office	n	The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959 . Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit - seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices . An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 -LRB- when control of that body changed party hands -RRB- , moreover , reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise , due to their majority - party status , over other resources such as committee staff .	35

office.n.141	office.n	office	n	A recent pro-choice rally in Trenton drew thousands , and in a major reversal , Congress is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest . `` If Webster had n't happened , you would n't be here , '' Linda Bowker tells a reporter in the Trenton office of the National Organization for Women . `` We could have shouted from the rooftops about Courter ... and no one would have heard us . ''	57
office.n.142	office.n	office	n	The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. Courter 's fortunes , but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate , pro-choice Gov. Kean . While the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government , anti-tax agenda in Washington , Gov. Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey 's budget in his eight years in office . Kean forces play down any differences with Mr. Courter , but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government .	80

dealer.n.3	dealer.n	dealer	n	Analysts viewed the chairman 's comments as an indication that the central bank is disinclined to ease monetary policy further in the near future . The dollar climbed immediately higher on news of Mr. Greenspan 's testimony , settling lower in later trade as dealers squared positions ahead of today 's preliminary report on third - quarter U.S. gross national product . In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8353 marks , down from 1.8355 marks Tuesday , and at 141.52 yen , up from 141.45 yen late Tuesday .	44
dealer.n.4	dealer.n	dealer	n	Market participants hope today 's GNP report will offer more substantial evidence on U.S. economic growth , although analysts are quick to point out that the figures may overstate the economy 's vigor . `` The ` r ' word is looming again , '' says one dealer , referring to persistent concern among some market analysts that the U.S. economy is heading toward a major slowdown if not a recession . Some dealers note that while the third - quarter figures may appear relatively bullish -- the market consensus calls for a 2.5 % annual growth rate , unchanged from the second - quarter rate -- it would take a significantly stronger figure to alter market perceptions that the economy is softening .	47

British postal authorities say they have uncovered a large - scale scheme where unscrupulous stamp dealers chemically removed stamp cancellations , regummed the stamps and sold them to U.S. collectors or , in large lots , to British businesses . The scheme allegedly cost the post office # 10 million -LRB- $ 16.1 -RRB- in revenue in the past 12 months .	44
dealer.n.8	dealer.n	dealer	n	The scheme allegedly cost the post office # 10 million -LRB- $ 16.1 -RRB- in revenue in the past 12 months .

dealer.n.11	dealer.n	dealer	n	UAL 's decision to remain an independent company sent share prices tumbling . By midmorning , the DJIA had plunged 80 points and foreign - exchange dealers quickly drove the dollar down . When the DJIA modestly rebounded , the dollar bounced back in choppy dealings but ended the day below the levels of late Monday .	26
dealer.n.12	dealer.n	dealer	n	Stock prices , meanwhile , posted significant gains in later trading and closed down by only 3.69 points on the day . Some dealers said that the market 's strong reaction to Wall Street reflects a general uneasiness about the dollar . They added that the DJIA 's swift drop proved an easy excuse for the market to drive the U.S. currency in the direction it was already headed .	23
dealer.n.13	dealer.n	dealer	n	But , they add that the mark 's strength is in part a reflection of a shift away from U.S. assets by Japanese investors into West German investments . `` The question remains : how much can the West German market absorb ? '' says one senior dealer . Some dealers say that Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita 's reassurance that Japanese monetary policy wo n't be changed for the time being has given investors an added excuse to push the yen down even further against the mark .	47

dealer.n.17	dealer.n	dealer	n	But as stock prices recovered some of the early losses , so did the U.S. currency . Although dealers said investors are becoming more bearish toward the dollar in the wake of the stock market 's recent troubles and as the U.S. economy weakens , the dollar ended down only modestly . In major market activity : Bond prices rose .	18
dealer.n.18	dealer.n	dealer	n	At London 's close , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 51.23 points lower at 2611.68 . Dealers said the initial pressure came from mildly disappointing U.K. trade figures for September and a worrisome report by the Confederation of British Industry that a decline in orders for manufactured goods is depressing both business optimism and investment plans for the coming year . The trade and CBI reports refocused attention on high interest rates and corporate profitability and helped rekindle underlying concerns over prospects for a recession in the U.K. , dealers said .	17

's disclosure to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it will seek 100 % of Jaguar 's shares outstanding when U.K. government share regulations are lifted at the end of next year . Tokyo stocks closed easier , posting their first loss in six trading days , partly because of programmed index - linked selling by trust investment funds in the afternoon session .	7
dealer.n.21	dealer.n	dealer	n	Traders say investors are worried that the CDU wo n't be able to hold office in federal elections at the end of 1990 . And statements by the chairman of the IG Metall labor union , Franz Steinkuehler , also cast a cloud over trading , dealers said . Mr. Steinkuehler said at a convention in West Berlin that the union has to prepare for `` a big fight '' to achieve its main goal of a 35 - hour workweek , down from current 37 - hour workweek .	46
dealer.n.22	dealer.n	dealer	n	But junk bonds took more hits . Early in the day , bond dealers said trading volume was heavy as large institutional investors scrambled to buy long - term Treasury bonds on speculation that the stock market 's volatility would lead to a `` flight - to - quality '' rally . That happens when nervous stock investors dump equities and buy Treasurys , which are higher in quality and thus considered safe .	13
dealer.n.23	dealer.n	dealer	n	RJR 's 14.70 % bonds due 2007 fell 2 1/2 points . Trading activity in the junk market was extremely light as dealers could n't find enough buyers to match sellers . `` While the stock market was falling , most -LCB- junk bond holders -RCB- were just watching it not knowing what to do , '' said Paul Suckow , director of fixed - income securities at Oppenheimer Management Corp .	22
dealer.n.24	dealer.n	dealer	n	The ratio , which reflects the number of bids the Treasury receives for each bid accepted , is used to gauge investor demand . Dealers said players shied away from the note sale because they were concerned that prices at the time of the auction might erode if the stock market staged a recovery , which , in fact , did happen . Individual and Japanese participation in the auction was disappointing , according to dealers .	24

dealer.n.31	dealer.n	dealer	n	London prices closed modestly higher in the year 's thinnest turnover , a condition that underscored a lack of conviction ahead of a U.K. balance of payments report Tuesday . Limited volume ahead of the September trade data showed the market is nervous , but dealers added that the day 's modest gains also signaled some support for London equities . They pegged the support largely to anticipation that Britain 's current account imbalance ca n't be much worse than the near record deficits seen in July and August .	45

dealer.n.37	dealer.n	dealer	n	The dollar posted gains in quiet trading as concerns about equities abated . Foreign exchange dealers said that the currency market has begun to distance itself from the volatile stock exchange , which has preoccupied the market since Oct. 13 , when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 190 points . Currency analysts predict that in the coming week the foreign exchange market will shift its focus back to economic fundamentals , keeping a close eye out for any signs of monetary easing by U.S. Federal Reserve .	15
dealer.n.38	dealer.n	dealer	n	The Nikkei , which reached as high as 35611.38 right after the opening , surrendered part of its early advance toward the end of the day because of profit - taking . `` Investors , especially dealers , do n't want to hold a position over the weekend , '' a trader at Dai - ichi Securities said , adding , though , that the trading mood remained positive through the afternoon session . The Tokyo Stock Price Index -LRB- Topix -RRB- of all issues listed in the First Section , which gained 22.78 points Thursday , was up 14.06 points , or 0.53 % , at 2679.72 .	36
dealer.n.39	dealer.n	dealer	n	The index finished 2.4 % under its close of 2233.9 the previous Friday , although it recouped some of the sharp losses staged early last week on the back of Wall Street 's fall . London was weak throughout Friday 's trading , however , on what dealers attributed to generally thin interest ahead of the weekend and this week 's potentially important U.K. trade figures for September . The FT - SE 100 largely remained within an 11 - point range establshed within the first hour of trading before it eased to an intraday low late in the session when a flurry of program selling pushed Wall Street lower .	47
dealer.n.40	dealer.n	dealer	n	Volume was extremely thin at 351.3 million shares , the lightest volume of the week and modestly under Thursday 's 387.4 million shares . Dealers said the day 's action was featureless outside some response to sterling 's early weakness against the mark , and fears that Wall Street might open lower after its strong leap forward Thursday . They added that market - makers were largely sidelined after aggressively supporting the market Thursday in their quest to cover internal shortages of FT - SE 100 shares .	24
dealer.n.41	dealer.n	dealer	n	British Airways rose initially after announcing its withdrawal from the UAL deal . Dealers said they viewed the initial # 390-million -LRB- $ 622 million -RRB- outlay for a 15 % stake in the airline as a bit much . Its shares slid in late dealings to close a penny per share lower at 197 pence .	13
dealer.n.42	dealer.n	dealer	n	B.A.T ended the day at 778 , down 5 , on turnover of 7.5 million shares . Dealers said it was hit by some profit - taking after gains since mid-week .

dealer.n.54	dealer.n	dealer	n	Passenger car prices jumped 3.8 % in September , after climbing 0.5 % in August and declining in the late spring and summer .

dealer.n.57	dealer.n	dealer	n	The poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month . Furthermore , dealers contacted late last week said they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of Friday 's steep market decline .

dealer.n.58	dealer.n	dealer	n	Lexus sales were n't available ; the cars are imported and Toyota reports their sales only at month - end . The sales drop for the No. 1 car maker may have been caused in part by the end in September of dealer incentives that GM offered in addition to consumer rebates and low - interest financing , a company spokesman said .

TCAC had already been active in community development efforts in Peipu , and its members knew from this experience that rebuilding from the earthquake would take a long time , so they set up Shihkang Work Station at Tuniu Elementary School in late October and made plans to stay for a year .

By sending a person to serve full-time at the Shihkang Work Station , TCAC has managed to quickly integrate itself into the local community in Shihkang , and to see where assistance is most urgently needed . The children of Shihkang , for example , are in especially great need of psychological counseling , so TCAC asked the Hsiuh-li Liuh Memorial Foundation to provide therapy for children and teachers .	70

community.n.171	community.n	community	n	It 's all documented in an ongoing statistical analysis called `` the Dartmouth College Atlas of Health Care , '' directed by Dr John Wennberg . What we 're seeing is that in health care geography is basically destiny , meaning you may be destined , if you live in one community , to have major surgery for the same problem normally treated , somewhere else , with a less invasive procedure or without surgery at all . For instance , the Atlas finds , a breast cancer patient in Rapid City , South Dakota is twice as likely to have a mastectomy , as a patient with the same problem in the western suburbs of Cleveland .	51
community.n.172	community.n	community	n	Not what you may think . Not the size of the community , the wealth of the patients , or quality of the hospital . It seems to be more what doctors in each area are used to recommending , but patients do n't know that .	11

That part of the resolution here and the resolution was never actually applied because right until now , the Yugoslav police and military were in the hands of Milosevic , so the international community did n't want to have anything to do with the Milosevic forces .

This song is from their latest play , The Last Train for Serbia , which was recorded on the day protestors stormed the federal parliament in Belgrade and the main television stations .	36
community.n.180	community.n	community	n	We are living all under very difficult conditions . Social aspirations is very difficult and that is something which has to do with Milosevic regime , sanctions of international community , bombing of this country last year , but what people mostly appreciate is that sense of freedom . The West has been rewarding the democratic reforms in Serbia with big aid packages , but the money comes with some conditions attached .	29
community.n.181	community.n	community	n	That 's an interesting little anecdote , is n't it ? Well , when this sort of thing happens in a small community and I guess that 's a under statement in this case , whether or not it all succeeds depends on how well some of the local people can keep secrets . Are people kind of , you know , in the fold on this , or are there things being leaked around to press here and there ?	22
community.n.182	community.n	community	n	He has only one aim , to return to the political scene and anyone who thinks otherwise is underestimating him .

Mr. Ahmad says that instead of sanctions , the international community should engage in a dialogue with the Taliban , but Russia 's Ambassador Serge Lavroff says the Taliban leadership does not inspire trust .

field.n.84	field.n	field	n	Taiwan Genome Sciences -LRB- TGS -RRB- , which was set up in November 1999 as a joint venture by the Uni-President Enterprises Group , Yuen Foong Yu and Tuntex Groups , only entered the biotechnology fray in April of this year . CEO Andrew Kuo says the investors came to the view that Taiwan needs to develop its biotechnology industries , and therefore they combined their resources to make a long-term investment in the field . TGS 's strategy is to invest in a number of US genome research companies , and to sign technology transfer agreements and chip production contracts with them .	74
field.n.85	field.n	field	n	"However , due to Taiwan 's early entry into biochip research and development , and the high state of development of its semiconductor industry , the island is well supplied with relevant technology and skills . Thus , says Lee , "" Taiwan should have opportunities to enter this field not merely as a contract manufacturer . "" The potential and importance of biochips is plain to see , but in this new , interdisciplinary industry , there are still many obstacles and difficulties to overcome ."	49
field.n.86	field.n	field	n	"The potential and importance of biochips is plain to see , but in this new , interdisciplinary industry , there are still many obstacles and difficulties to overcome . Apart from the fact that the technology is not yet mature , and that generally accepted , mutually compatible international standards have not yet emerged , the biggest bottleneck for biochips at the moment is the many thousands of patents which have been taken out in the field , which limit the avenues available to each player . "" Because this area is a patents minefield , it 's impossible to create a product which from start to finish does n't infringe on anyone else 's patents , "" says Johnsee Lee ."	76
field.n.87	field.n	field	n	"The two largest media groups in Taiwan , whose flagship papers are United Daily News and the China Times , began invading the human resources market two years ago , and existing job banks went on a binge of mergers . For example , Career Magazine , which has more than a decade of experience in the field , founded an e - counterpart , which then merged with the "" 37 "" employment website -LRB- the resulting site is now called www.Career.com -RRB- to provide even more comprehensive services . The big may have gotten bigger , but that has n't stopped newcomers from jumping into the fray ."	57
field.n.88	field.n	field	n	Finding a profitable market niche is something that all the newcomers have in mind . Last year , Yam Digital Technology and InterServ International got together in a joint venture to establish HRGini , which targets middle - and high - ranking managers in high-tech fields who have incomes in excess of one million NT dollars per year . Director Janet Chen relates that the company employs state - of - the - art psychological profiling services , with job candidates first being screened by a psychological consultant in one - on - one interviews ; only if the applicant fits the corporate culture will he or she be recommended to the client firm .	45

field.n.90	field.n	field	n	This ignores the evolution of land - sea - air joint operations in modern warfare . Mainland China need not choose to use high-cost , limited-quantity guided missiles , but could instead use a large number of 360 - km range rockets to first attack Taiwan 's air fields from the Chinese coast , thereby paralyzing Taiwan 's air superiority . Then , their navy could ferry raiders to Taiwan in less than one hour .	48
field.n.91	field.n	field	n	Then , their navy could ferry raiders to Taiwan in less than one hour . Kao recalls that Vietnamese land forces were used to infiltrate US air fields in Vietnam and neutralize American air superiority . Particularly now that the Coastal Defense Law has been passed , and responsibility for coastal patrols will pass to the non-military Coast Guard Command , if Taiwan 's military still operates under the traditional assumption of first establishing air and sea superiority followed by defense on land , this could give mainland China an opportunity to strike a death blow .	27

cell.n.13	cell.n	cell	n	Dr. Dryja made his retinoblastoma discovery in 1986 . Then last spring , researchers reported finding a gene called p53 which , if impaired , turns healthy colon cells cancerous .

Occasionally , gross chromosome damage was visible .	44
cell.n.15	cell.n	cell	n	Then , a scientific team led by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee , then at the University of Utah , found the answer . The team used a battery of the newly developed `` gene probes , '' snippets of genetic material that can track a gene 's presence in a cell .

cell.n.17	cell.n	cell	n	It was an audacious claim .

cell.n.20	cell.n	cell	n	`` It was the confirming evidence we all needed that -LCB- gene -RCB- losses were critical to the development of a common tumor , '' says Ray White at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Salt Lake City . But Dr. Vogelstein had yet to nail the identity of the gene that , if damaged , flipped a colon cell into full - blown malignancy . They focused on chromosome 17 .	58
cell.n.21	cell.n	cell	n	They focused on chromosome 17 . For months the Johns Hopkins researchers , using gene probes , experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17 , looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells . Such a piece of DNA would probably constitute a gene .	39
cell.n.22	cell.n	cell	n	When they found it last winter , Dr. Vogelstein was dubious that the search was over . His doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a Princeton University researcher , Arnold Levine , had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones . The deletion Dr. Vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53 .	49
cell.n.23	cell.n	cell	n	But Mr. Levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth , whereas the Johns Hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth . Despite that , when the Johns Hopkins scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with the Mr. Levine 's p53 gene they found the two were identical ; it turned out that in Mr. Levine 's cancer studies , he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 -- a cancer - suppressing gene . The discovery `` suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation , '' says Robert Weinberg , a leader in cancer - gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge , Mass .	46
cell.n.24	cell.n	cell	n	The p53 gene has just been implicated in lung cancer . In a report out last week , John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene .

The spy network would serve two clients : the Panamanian government , by monitoring political opponents in the region , and the U.S. , by tracking the growing Communist influence in the unions organized at United Fruit Co.

officer.n.140	officer.n	officer	n	this is from uh Dr. Howard Osofsky from ~LSU medical school /.

Uh actually first let me go to Joe Tackapena on that /.	33
officer.n.141	officer.n	officer	n	These guys stayed /. Two officers um committed suicide /. two hundred and forty nine investigated for leaving their posts without permission /.	5

officer.n.144	officer.n	officer	n	I I think that uh neither frustration nor fatigue would justify this kind of misconduct /.

Victoria Habathee if you were asked to testify in some sort of be proceeding be it a pre-trial hearing be it a trial be it to to provide uh general thoughts on on the psychological condi- conditions of some of these officers knowing what you know about what happened in New Orleans , is it fair for some of them to say everything that happened the amount of hours we were working the fact that we 've been away from our families etcetera from the psychological point of view does that explain what we see on the video tape /?	27

officer.n.146	officer.n	officer	n	It does explain in the sense the human reaction to such a a excessive event /. And remembering that these officers were not only keeping the peace so to speak and uh responding but they were also victims /. Um and would you -- I mean w- we we heard /-	20
officer.n.147	officer.n	officer	n	but I think the men and women in New Orleans police department on the -- on the whole are coping with it as best they can /. I do n't -- I 'm not ready to say at this particular time until we are actually able to talk to the officers in depth about the actions if stress had anything to do with this situation /.

officer.n.152	officer.n	officer	n	Well is n't it true that in fact this program was hinted at in the Nine Eleven Commission report /?

Let 's look at what they wrote in The New York Times about this /.	38
officer.n.153	officer.n	officer	n	The admiral reviewing the actions of the captain and crew of the `` USS Cole '' is recommending no punishment for the ship 's commander . Pentagon sources tell CNN Admiral Robert Natter 's decision must still be approved by two top Navy officials , but the recommendation makes it unlikely the ship 's commanding officer will face any disciplinary action . The admiral concluded Commander Kirk Lippold 's actions , while not perfect , fell within the `` acceptable '' range of conduct .	55
officer.n.154	officer.n	officer	n	A Pentagon official says Defense Secretary William Cohen may ask for a broader review of the `` USS Cole '' suicide bombing . Specifically , he wants to know if other officers in the chain of command above the ship 's captain should be held accountable for security lapses . A Navy inquiry under way is looking at the ship 's self - protection plan .	31
officer.n.155	officer.n	officer	n	A Navy inquiry under way is looking at the ship 's self - protection plan . According to `` the Washington Post , '' the officer in charge of the inquiry says no one should be punished for security lapses . 17 sailors lost their lives in the attack .	25
officer.n.156	officer.n	officer	n	While many were not required because the `` Cole '' was refueling in the harbor , not at a pier , others were judged to be significant lapses , according to sources . For instance , the ship protection plan filed by the `` Cole 's '' commanding officer of terrorism and warned to be suspicious and inquisitive of strangers . Another provision specifically warned that small boats require special concern because they can serve as an ideal platform for terrorists , but Lippold failed to ensure the those briefings were given according to Pentagon sources .	48
officer.n.157	officer.n	officer	n	The 40 - foot hole in the side of the `` USS Cole '' has now been patched , and the warship is in Mississippi for repairs that will cost $ 240 million and take a year to complete . Senior Navy officials are still debating the fate of Commander Lippold , who along with several subordinate officers , could be subject to career - ending discipline , if it 's judged the security lapses left the billion - dollar destroyer more vulnerable to attack . Jamie McIntyre , CNN , the Pentagon .	57
officer.n.158	officer.n	officer	n	They 've been sticking close together ever since . Medical officers say they became a team while in captivity and want to stay together as a team until it 's time to go to their separate homes .	10
officer.n.159	officer.n	officer	n	Of the 46 people arrested , 39 are African - American . The case against them was based on the testimony of undercover officer Thomas Coleman . Coleman claimed he bought drugs from the defendants , but offered little or no supporting evidence .	23
officer.n.160	officer.n	officer	n	Man spread - eagle with a two - year - old child . The officer is going to go in and swoop her away . As we understand it , the man had the child .	14
officer.n.161	officer.n	officer	n	The man came out and did the spread - eagle like that . Just as he did that , that 's when you saw the child just walking just a few feet away from him but the officers were able to get the child away . They handcuffed the man and they took him into custody .	37
officer.n.162	officer.n	officer	n	I am a photographer at Detroit Free Press and currently working in Baghdad and been here about a week and a half . 156 Iraqi police officers were supposed to show up to this college to report for work , but instead , 2,000 showed up because they heard about it on the radio , so the whole college was swarmed with police officers wanting their jobs back , and this gentleman was kind of in charge of the whole operation and one man has his arms up yelling at him . Was basically an angry officer demanding his job .	26

officer.n.165	officer.n	officer	n	The 11th executive of Health South charged with two counts of bank fraud .

officer.n.166	officer.n	officer	n	As soon as the police officers pulled the gun out and held it up , I knew it was my rifle .	5
officer.n.167	officer.n	officer	n	This evening , about 8:45 p.m. , members of my fugitive unit received a telephone call from an informant saying they thought that they had observed the suspect Derrick Lee in the area of Woods Drive and Donald Lee Holland Parkway in southwest Atlanta . The officers responded to that location , noticed a suspect fitting the description , approached Derrick Lee , asked for identification . Derrick Lee produced Louisiana identification .	46
officer.n.168	officer.n	officer	n	Enron 's bankruptcy cost thousands of people their jobs and their life savings and Kenny Lay and the chairman and president , both of that company remain unindicted . The chief financial officer is the only one there taking the fall . WorldCom once employed 80,000 people and went broke on the largest corporate bankruptcy in the United States .	32
officer.n.169	officer.n	officer	n	I think we are looking at in market stores and sales over the next coming days . We have police officers looking for them and will prosecute anyone seen selling them or buying them .	20
officer.n.170	officer.n	officer	n	Well , I think the number one most important sign is looking at what happened last night , and that is last night at about 7:00 , the public information officer of the court came to us and said we 're going home . We are told , in effect , there wo n't be a ruling tonight .	30
officer.n.171	officer.n	officer	n	Remember , very often , the justices are joint in another justice 's opinion . It also could be that the opinion is already finished , and , of course , there 's always the possibility that it 's not finished , but I think the fact that the public information office and many security officers here at the court are still here tells us that the court is in all likelihood still working on this case .	55
officer.n.172	officer.n	officer	n	Tonight , the latest casualty figures are 6 dead , 11 missing and 36 wounded , but Navy officials predict that death toll will surely rise in what is the worst terrorist attack against a U.S. Navy ship in modern history . The gaping , blackened hole in the side of the `` USS Cole '' is all the evidence the Navy 's top officer needs to declare this a terrorist attack . I have no reason to think that this was anything but a senseless act of terrorism .	64

market.n.163	market.n	market	n	The rumor , which has been neither confirmed nor denied , has China buying 125,000 to 200,000 bales for near - term delivery . One floor trader said that if there were Chinese purchases , they should have had a bigger effect on the market . Another said that if China was a buyer , it would be the earliest that country had made purchases since the 1979 - 80 crop year , and thus would be a bullish sign .	44
market.n.164	market.n	market	n	This trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the fundamentalists , who see higher prices ahead , and the technicians , who are basically buying cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range , around 71 cents , and selling it when the price climbs more than 74 cents . This trader said that he thought the market would turn aggressively bullish from a technical standpoint if the December contract was able to exceed 75.75 cents .

market.n.165	market.n	market	n	The December contract ended at $ 999 a metric ton , down $ 15 . The market is drifting , at least partly , because of a lack of crop information out of Ghana and the Ivory Coast , the two largest African producers . Harry Schwartz , a soft commodity specialist for Cargill Investors Services in New York , said the only report Ghana has issued about the arrival of cocoa from the interior was for 7,839 metric tons as of Oct. 12 .	16
market.n.166	market.n	market	n	He said that if little cocoa actually has arrived at the ports , shipping delays could result . This is the worry that probably brought steadiness to the market earlier in the week , he said . There was also some fear that without Ivory Coast cocoa a large French cocoa merchant , Cie . Financiere Sucre et Denrees , might not be able to deliver cocoa against the contracts it had sold earlier for December delivery in London .	28
market.n.167	market.n	market	n	However , the French merchant has about 200,000 tons of old crop Ivory Coast cocoa stored in the Netherlands from an agreement it had negotiated with the Ivory Coast last spring . Cargill thinks that even though the merchant has a contract stating that it wo n't bring this cocoa to market until after March 1991 , there is some evidence the contract has been modified . This modification , apparently , would permit the French merchant to deliver this cocoa , if necessary , against existing short positions .	51

market.n.178	market.n	market	n	As competition heats up in Spain 's crowded bank market , Banco Exterior de Espana is seeking to shed its image of a state - owned bank and move into new activities .

market.n.179	market.n	market	n	Some analysts are concerned , however , that Banco Exterior may have waited too long to diversify from its traditional export - related activities . Catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services , they argue , will be difficult , particularly if market conditions turn sour .

As a result , the volume of Banco Exterior 's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas -LRB- $ 7.04 billion -RRB- as of Dec. 31 , 1986 , to its current 522 billion pesetas .	31
market.n.183	market.n	market	n	The other two main pillars of Banco Exterior 's traditional business -- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading -- also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs . The bank was hamstrung in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government , analysts say . Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November , Banco Exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes .	48
market.n.184	market.n	market	n	Last year 's drop in export credit was partially offset by a 15 % surge in lending to individuals and small and medium - sized companies . Though Spain has an excess of banks , analysts say the country still has one of the most profitable markets in Europe , which will aid Banco Exterior with the tough tasks it faces ahead . Expansion plans also include acquisitions in growing foreign markets .	46

market.n.194	market.n	market	n	Pressure has been building on the Big Board in the past two weeks to do something about market volatility , which many investors say is caused by program trading . The market 's Friday - the - 13th plunge of 190 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , and the Big Board 's understated response to it , galvanized some longstanding dissatisfaction among companies listed on the exchange . Last month , program trading accounted for a record 13.8 % of average daily Big Board volume .	31

market.n.275	market.n	market	n	To avoid this problem , government should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to collect .

market.n.315	market.n	market	n	Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from -LRB- a -RRB- Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; -LRB- b -RRB- planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state - owned and penalties are paid by the government ; and -LRB- c -RRB- the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West . They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership , genuine competition based on market factors , and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions .

market.n.327	market.n	market	n	Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells , which it did n't provide in 1986 .

market.n.347	market.n	market	n	Analysts predict a 3.5 % rise in the deflator , after climbing 4.6 % in the second quarter . They note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap in August was reported earlier this month , hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed and sentiment gripped the market that the U.S. economy was losing its momentum . A 190 - point plunge in U.S. stock shares compounded the view , they say .	55
market.n.348	market.n	market	n	`` If we 're not headed for a recession , we 're certainly headed for a major slowdown . '' While the market expects little reaction from news of U.S. durable goods orders , scheduled for release today , participants note that the figures will probably serve to reinforce this bearish sentiment . U.S. durable goods orders are expected to show a decline of 1.2 % in September , according to economists .	22

But as an 80 % owner , if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market , it would likely depress the price of its shares . Some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will , instead , seek to convert the company 's shares to cash , in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just dumping stock on the market .	44

market.n.355	market.n	market	n	London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks were down only 4,800 metric tons for the week to 84,500 tons ; expectations late last week were a drop of 10,000 to 15,000 tons . The New York market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $ 1.23 - a - pound level , selling picked up as previous buyers bailed out of their positions and aggressive short sellers -- anticipating further declines -- moved in . Fund selling also picked up at that point .	34
market.n.356	market.n	market	n	Fund selling also picked up at that point . According to Bernard Savaiko , senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber , the only stability to the market came when short sellers periodically moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts . This activity produced small rallies , which in turn attracted new short selling .	25
market.n.357	market.n	market	n	Such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium traders because both metals are used in automobile catalytic converters . Mr. Savaiko theorized that the news on cold fusion did n't affect the market yesterday because many traders have already been badly burnt by such stories . He said the traders are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy palladium again .	33
market.n.358	market.n	market	n	Also weighing on both metals ' prices is the role of the chief supplier , the Soviet Union .

But with no reports of either country actually entering the market , analysts said , futures prices became vulnerable . Developing countries such as India , some analysts said , seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range , around 14.75 cents , and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range , around 13.50 cents .	45

Limited volume ahead of the September trade data showed the market is nervous , but dealers added that the day 's modest gains also signaled some support for London equities . They pegged the support largely to anticipation that Britain 's current account imbalance ca n't be much worse than the near record deficits seen in July and August .	40

market.n.384	market.n	market	n	Eastman Kodak Co. , seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high - definition television market , unveiled a converter that can transform conventional motion - picture film into high - definition video .

market.n.390	market.n	market	n	William D. Forrester , president of the U.S. - U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council , has a warning for U.S. companies trying to do business in the Soviet Union . `` It 's an extremely complex market , and you have to be prepared to make a big commitment , '' Mr. Forrester says . `` We are not trying to encourage everyone . ''	36
market.n.391	market.n	market	n	`` We are not trying to encourage everyone . '' Undeterred by such words of caution , corporate America is flocking to Moscow , lured by a huge untapped market and Mikhail Gorbachev 's attempt to overhaul the Soviet economy . Doing business with the Russians , once the pursuit of a handful of hardened veterans , has become the goal of such major companies as General Motors Corp. , Federal Express Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. , as well as a cluster of smaller firms .	29
market.n.392	market.n	market	n	And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles , their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation 's republics . `` You have to go out to all your constituents , '' says James H. Giffen , who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by U.S. firms to break into the Soviet market , involving investment of more than $ 5 billion in some two dozen joint ventures . As part of that attempt , by the American Trade Consortium , Mr. Giffen says he spends a lot of time lobbying .	72
market.n.393	market.n	market	n	And unruly crowds at RJR Nabisco Inc. 's booth almost knocked over a glass showcase in the rush to get a free Camel cigarette sticker . Some U.S. products are filtering into the Soviet market under an emergency import program . Both Colgate and Procter & Gamble have received big orders for toothpaste , soap and detergents .	34
market.n.394	market.n	market	n	Because the Soviet ruble is n't convertible into dollars , marks and other Western currencies , companies that hope to set up production facilities here must either export some of the goods to earn hard currency or find Soviet goods they can take in a counter-trade transaction . International competition for the few Soviet goods that can be sold on world markets is heating up , however . Shelley M. Zeiger , an entrepreneur from New Jersey who buys Soviet porcelain and `` matryoshka '' nesting dolls for export to the U.S. , says West German companies already have snapped up much of the production of these items .	61
market.n.395	market.n	market	n	At Lloyd 's of London , underwriters still scratch out policies using fountain pens and blotting paper . Visitors are ushered into the premises by red - frocked doormen known as waiters , a reminder of the insurance market 's origins in a coffeehouse in 17th century London . Such trappings suggest a glorious past but give no hint of a troubled present .	38
market.n.396	market.n	market	n	Such trappings suggest a glorious past but give no hint of a troubled present . Lloyd 's , once a pillar of the world insurance market , is being shaken to its very foundation . The 301 - year - old exchange is battered by enormous claims from a decade - long run of unprecedented disasters , the most recent of which is last week 's earthquake in California 's Bay Area .	25
market.n.397	market.n	market	n	At the same time , Lloyd 's is besieged by disgruntled investors and hamstrung by inefficient but time - honored ways of conducting business . The exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow , less - profitable segments of the market by less hidebound competitors . `` Lloyd 's is on the ropes , '' says Peter Nutting , a Lloyd 's investor for 17 years who now leads a dissident group threatening to sue exchange underwriters for alleged mismanagement and negligence .	40
market.n.398	market.n	market	n	Lloyd 's is being squeezed out of low - margin but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance . Over the past decade , competitors have chipped away at the exchange 's share of the # 2.5 billion marine market in London , where half the world 's ships are insured . Lloyd 's 66 % stake in that market has shrunk to 50 % in that period , according to an official at the Institute of London Underwriters , a Lloyd 's competitor .	44

market.n.400	market.n	market	n	Though Lloyd 's pioneered such now - standard policies as worker 's compensation insurance , burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses , and bankers ' liability insurance , competitors now underwrite most of that business . Beyond that , many big oil , chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through `` captive '' offshore companies for industry - specific coverage . Even Lloyd 's specialty -- unusually risky ventures -- is being challenged .	54
market.n.401	market.n	market	n	Only 10 years ago , for instance , Lloyd 's was the pre-eminent insurer of thoroughbred horses . But since 1981 , Kirk Horse Insurance Inc. of Lexington , Ky. has grabbed a 20 % stake of the market . Ronald Kirk , president , says Lloyd 's has suffered because its structure does n't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients ; brokers are required intermediaries .	38
market.n.402	market.n	market	n	`` This is a watershed time , and we are trying to plot our way ahead , '' he says . `` We have been a great market for inventing risks which other people then take , copy and cut rates . '' Lloyd 's , he says , is cut off from `` the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which acts as a steadying influence '' against catastrophic losses .	27
market.n.403	market.n	market	n	By that , he means low - margin but low - risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance . The exchange , he says , must find new products and new markets . That wo n't be an easy task .	34
market.n.404	market.n	market	n	But along with such treasured artifacts as Lord Nelson 's spyglass , Lloyd 's also brought its outmoded ways of doing business . The Lloyd 's market actively underwrites insurance just 4 1/2 hours a day , brokers say . Underwriting does n't get under way until after morning tea at 10 a.m .	26
market.n.405	market.n	market	n	Some underwriters have been pressing for years to tap the low - margin business by selling some policies directly to consumers . Lloyd 's presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public , and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the U.K. and Canada . But such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters , brokers and administrators before being implemented .	42
market.n.406	market.n	market	n	`` That seems to be what all my friends are using to take the grandkids to the lake , '' she says . Market segmentation in cars is n't new , but it 's far more extensive than when Alfred P. Sloan Jr. conceived the idea 50 years ago . The legendary GM chairman declared that his company would make `` a car for every purse and purpose . ''	23
market.n.407	market.n	market	n	Now there are many cars for every purse and purpose . Just four years ago , GM planners divided the combined car and truck market into seven segments . Today , they identify 19 distinct segments for cars , and another 11 for trucks and vans .	24
market.n.408	market.n	market	n	Today , they identify 19 distinct segments for cars , and another 11 for trucks and vans . The number of makes has mushroomed because the U.S. is the world 's biggest and richest market for automobiles ; virtually every auto maker wants to sell here . For every brand like Renault or Fiat that has been squeezed out , others such as Isuzu , Daihatsu and Mitsubishi have come in .	34
market.n.409	market.n	market	n	GM 's Pontiac division is offering a turbo - charged V - 6 engine on its Grand Prix model , even though it expects to sell only about 4,000 cars equipped with that option . The reason : Items with narrow appeal can be important in a market as fragmented as today 's . Americans spent more than $ 190 billion on new cars and trucks last year , and just 1 % of that market exceeded Polaroid Co. 's sales of $ 1.86 billion .	47

The company could command a good price in the market . `` Over the past three and a half years , apparel companies , many of whom have strong brand names , have been bought at about 60 % of sales , '' says Deborah Bronston , Prudential - Bache Securities Inc. apparel analyst .	31
market.n.412	market.n	market	n	And investors and traders alike say the current turmoil could take years to resolve . Amid the market disorder , even Drexel , which has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond investors , is pulling in its horns . Although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market , Drexel has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults , withdrawn new offerings , redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once - devoted investors .	17
market.n.413	market.n	market	n	The junk market , which mushroomed to $ 200 billion from less than $ 2 billion at the start of the decade , has been declining for months as issuers have stumbled under the weight of hefty interest payments . The fragile market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp. , which created its U.S. retailing empire with more than $ 3 billion in junk financing . Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdale 's department store chain up for sale .	42
market.n.414	market.n	market	n	In an interview , Mr. Joseph says his dinner discussion with the Prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk . `` What I thought I was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and , appropriately enough , quite quality - conscious , which is not at all bad , '' he says . `` Nobody 's been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years , and we 're going to make sure our default rates are going to be in the acceptable parameters of the market .

Strasser say the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise . In recent months , they say , there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market 's traditional investors , while new buyers have n't materialized to replace them .

Investors , trying to raise cash , have sold `` large liquid issues '' such as RJR Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co. ; declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market 's distress . And , Deltec said , buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation .	66

market.n.421	market.n	market	n	The junk market 's `` yield hogs are learning a real painful lesson , '' he says . Although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default , the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble , says Stuart Reese , manager of Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. 's $ 17 billion investment - grade public bond portfolio . `` But we think the risks are there for things getting a lot worse .	32
market.n.422	market.n	market	n	The big insurer , unlike Prudential , owns only about $ 150 million of publicly sold junk bonds . The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year , probably will persist , some analysts say . `` If anything , we 're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' says Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management .	35
market.n.423	market.n	market	n	His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34 % . One indication of a growing number of junk defaults , Mr. Asquith says , is that about half of the $ 3 billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by S&P this year are junk bonds sold during the market 's big issue years of 1984 through 1986 . These bonds , now rated single - D , include junk offerings by AP Industries , Columbia Savings -LRB- Colorado -RRB- , First Texas Savings Association , Gilbraltar Financial Corp. , Integrated Resources Inc. , Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp. , Resorts International Inc. , Southmark Corp. and Vyquest Inc .	62

market.n.426	market.n	market	n	Amid heavy buying of shares in Belgium 's largest insurer , Maurice Lippens also warned in an interview that a white knight , in buying out a raider , could leave speculators with big losses on their AG stock . Since the beginning of the year , the stock has nearly doubled , giving AG a market value of about 105 billion Belgian francs -LRB- $ 2.7 billion -RRB- . The most likely white knight would be Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. , which already owns 18 % of AG and which itself is controlled by Cie .

market.n.427	market.n	market	n	The legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee and the Senate Securities Subcommittee . Richard Breeden , the new chairman of the SEC , has n't taken a formal position on the bill , which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the SEC additional authority during market emergencies . However , he recently told the Senate Banking Committee that he believes the agency should have explicit authority to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of broker - dealers , which are frequently used to issue bridge loans .	67
market.n.428	market.n	market	n	The bridge loans are intended to provide temporary financing for acquisitions . Since such loans are often refinanced through the sale of high - risk , high - yield junk bonds , the recent woes of the junk - bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated with Wall Street firms issuing bridge loans . But some Wall Street executives argue that such fears are unwarranted .	40
market.n.429	market.n	market	n	Falcon Cable Systems Co. said it proposed an amendment that would allow it to increase its debt cap to 65 % of the company 's fair market value from the 40 % currently allowed .

Brown - tobacco cigarettes such as Gauloises now make up just 40 % of the French tobacco market , half the level of about two decades ago . While Seita retains a manufacturing monopoly in France , it is being hurt by rising imports and from waning cigarette demand .	28
market.n.431	market.n	market	n	So Seita has introduced blonde cigarettes under the Gauloises label , and intends to relaunch the unsuccessful Gitanes Blondes in new packaging , similar to the slide - packs used by brown - tobacco Gitanes .

The comments were the ministry 's first detailed public statement on the subject , and reflect the ministry 's concern that foreigners will think Japan is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets . A number of accounts of the events leading to the 190 point drop in New York stock prices on Oct. 13 accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the UAL deal for one reason or another .	61
market.n.438	market.n	market	n	`` We made our own decision , '' he said . Still , Mr. Utsumi may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in orchestrating recent moves by Japanese banks . All week there has been much speculation in financial circles in Tokyo and abroad about the ministry 's real position .	21
market.n.439	market.n	market	n	Japanese banks are under `` political pressure '' as well , the analyst said . Moreover , analysts point out that Japanese banks have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if they offer the chance to build market share , cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats . Clearly , some financial authorities are concerned about the Japanese banks role in leveraged buy - outs .	41
market.n.440	market.n	market	n	While recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy - out fever , Japanese banks are n't likely to walk away from the game . Despite the risks , the deals can be an attractive way for Japanese banks to increase their presence in the U.S. market , bank analysts say . Flush with cash at home , but with fewer customers to lend to , leading banks are eager to expand overseas .	47

market.n.445	market.n	market	n	Output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out . But industry and OPEC officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to glut the market and cause an oil - price collapse a few months from now if OPEC does n't soon adopt a new quota system to corral its chronic cheaters . As a result , the effort by some oil ministers to get OPEC to approve a new permanent production - sharing agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency .	44
market.n.446	market.n	market	n	Ali Khalifa Al - Sabah , Kuwait 's oil minister , recently estimated OPEC capacity at 25 million barrels a day .

market.n.454	market.n	market	n	That 's a fundamental lesson for investors , but its truth was demonstrated once again in the performance of mutual funds during and after the stock market 's Friday - the - 13th plunge . Stock funds , like the market as a whole , generally dropped more than 2 % in the week through last Thursday , according to figures compiled by Lipper Analytical Services Inc .

The board had also been expected to approve a SKr1.5 billion international offering of new Trelleborg shares .	35
market.n.492	market.n	market	n	The board had also been expected to approve a SKr1.5 billion international offering of new Trelleborg shares . But that share issue -- intended to make Trelleborg better known among international investors -- was postponed until market conditions stabilize , people familiar with the situation say . Trelleborg 's internationally traded `` Bfree '' series stock plunged SKr29 -LRB- $ 4.48 -RRB- to SKr205 -LRB- $ 31.65 -RRB- in volatile trading Monday in Stockholm .	36
market.n.493	market.n	market	n	A family foundation set up by late founder Henry Dunker controls 59 % of Trelleborg 's voting shares outstanding . But the foundation bylaws require the entire Trelleborg stake to be sold in the open market if control drops below 50 % . That possibility had crept closer as repeated new share offerings to finance Trelleborg 's rapid growth steadily diluted the foundation 's holding .	35
market.n.494	market.n	market	n	The West German chemical concern said it will close the last remaining fertilizer plant in Oberhausen in the fall of next year . Hoechst said the fertilizer market faces overcapacity in Western Europe , rising imports from East bloc countries and overseas , and declining demand .	27
market.n.495	market.n	market	n	Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund . For any given move in the overall market , it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall . Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret .	24
market.n.496	market.n	market	n	Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret . The beta of the broad market , typically defined as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , is always 1.0 . So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile , one at 1.5 is 50 % more volatile , and so on .	15
market.n.497	market.n	market	n	Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas . Go with high - beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market . Remember , though , that beta also has important limitations .	29
market.n.498	market.n	market	n	`` Beta is only part of the risk in a stock , '' says William F. Sharpe , the Stanford University emeritus professor who developed the measure . `` There is risk that is not associated with market moves , and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that . '' In particular , beta does n't measure the company - and industry - specific risk associated with an individual stock .	37
market.n.499	market.n	market	n	`` Our fear was people would look just at the beta -LCB- of a gold fund -RCB- and say here is an investment with very low risk , '' says John Markese , director of research for the Chicago - based group . `` In reality it 's very volatile , but the movements are not because of market movements .	58
market.n.500	market.n	market	n	USX Corp. and its Japanese partner , Kobe Steel Ltd. , agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce hot - dipped galvanized sheet products , mainly for the automotive market . Terms were n't disclosed for the plant , which will have annual capacity of 600,000 tons .	35
market.n.501	market.n	market	n	That trend could increase demand for hot - dipped galvanized sheet . The hot - dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest - growing and most profitable segments of the steel market , coveted by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and reconstructed mills -- those spun off to employees . Indeed , USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992 , compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988 .	32

Indeed , USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992 , compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988 . For the first eight months of 1989 , analysts say shipments of hot - dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier , while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 % .	53
market.n.503	market.n	market	n	`` When elephants start fighting , ants get killed , '' says Murray Riese , co-owner of National Restaurants , a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut , Roy Rogers and other chains . As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another , franchisers are struggling desperately for market share , slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions . The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast - food chains and their franchisees .	50
market.n.504	market.n	market	n	The National Restaurant Association says quick - service restaurant units in the U.S. rose 14 % to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987 , the last year for which figures are available . With the market so crowded , says a spokesman for Wendy 's in Columbus , Ohio , `` If you 're doing well , you 're doing well at someone else 's expense . '' Simply put , there is n't enough business for every store to grow .	34

The new chip `` is a very big step in computing , and it is important that Olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product , '' said Patricia Meagher Davis , an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London .

Executives at Olivetti , whose earnings have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years , have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market . Ms. Davis said the new machines could steal some sales away from Olivetti 's own minicomputers , but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers , stockbrokers and medical doctors .	78
market.n.507	market.n	market	n	Although Olivetti 's profits tumbled 40 % in the first half of this year , she believes Olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year , especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by December . `` We think the worst is over '' in the European information - technology market , she said . Depending on the type of software and peripherals used , the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals -LRB- a role usually filled by a minicomputer -RRB- , as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer .	69
market.n.508	market.n	market	n	Like all Americans seeking chronic prosperity , I do find it necessary to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools , if only to assuage my father - in - law , who believes in such things . So throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs , and tinkered with stocks , bonds and mutual funds , as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real - estate market . Return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative .	77
market.n.509	market.n	market	n	By 1987 , these properties were in a tailspin , causing my broker at Pru - Bache to remark that she 'd `` never seen anything like it . '' Concerned for her state of mind , I dropped them -- and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health . Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real - estate market , which was booming until I entered it in late 1988 , at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years .	43

market.n.511	market.n	market	n	Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy -LRB- Figure 5 -RRB- , with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60 % of the car 's original value . According to my calculations , these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $ 22,000 on the open market -LRB- Figure 6 -RRB- , where I plan to offer it shortly . Expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns , shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale .	57

While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore , the price surge of 1979 - 80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use , Mr. Edgar says .	41

market.n.516	market.n	market	n	Even in the present uncertain investment climate , investors are preferring `` quality assets '' such as Treasury bills and bonds to gold , silver and platinum , dealers say . Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar , precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation , dealers say . Silver , however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum .	41
market.n.517	market.n	market	n	`` There 's just too much silver around , '' says Tom Butler , an analyst at Samuel Montagu & Co. , a London bullion house . A huge silver stockpile at exchanges , refiners , consuming industries and government warehouses of at least 617 million ounces is the market depressant , says Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in a report . This year alone , inventories at the Commodity Exchange of New York jumped `` by a staggering 46 million to 221 million ounces '' because of producer deliveries , de-stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors , says Rhona O'Connell , London - based precious metals analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton .	49

market.n.536	market.n	market	n	It also marks P&G 's growing concern that its Japanese rivals , such as Kao Corp. , may bring their superconcentrates to the U.S. . The Cincinnati consumer - products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent , called Attack , which quickly won a 30 % stake in the Japanese markets . `` They do n't want to get caught again , '' says one industry watcher .	58
market.n.537	market.n	market	n	`` They do n't want to get caught again , '' says one industry watcher . Retailers in Phoenix , Ariz. , say P&G 's new powdered detergent -- to be called Cheer with Color Guard -- will be on shelves in that market by early November . A P&G spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to Phoenix started late last month .	43
market.n.538	market.n	market	n	A P&G spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to Phoenix started late last month . She said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others . Superconcentrates are n't entirely new for P&G .	22
market.n.539	market.n	market	n	The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack . When Attack hit the shelves in 1987 , P&G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % . With the help of Lemon Cheer , P&G 's share is now estimated to be 12 % .	30
market.n.540	market.n	market	n	With the help of Lemon Cheer , P&G 's share is now estimated to be 12 % . While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for P&G will be in the $ 4 billion U.S. detergent market , where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders . The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name since it 's already expanded its best - selling Tide into 16 different varieties , including this year 's big hit , Tide with Bleach .	46
market.n.541	market.n	market	n	In the early 1980s , P&G tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name that it markets in Europe . But the product , which was n't as concentrated as the new Cheer , bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped . P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience .	41
market.n.542	market.n	market	n	Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S. . To be sure , Kao would n't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G , which has about 23 % of the market . Kao officials previously have said they are interested in selling detergents in the U.S. , but so far the company has focused on acquisitions , such as last year 's purchase of Andrew Jergens Co. , a Cincinnati hand - lotion maker .	30

market.n.546	market.n	market	n	After falling for three consecutive months , the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9 % last month , the Labor Department reported Friday , as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer . Although the report , which was released before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the 190.58 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline .

market.n.548	market.n	market	n	Mrs. Hills ' remarks did raise questions , at least among some U.S. officials , about what exactly her stance is on U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market . The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10 % for years . Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20 % share by 1991 , but the Japanese have denied making any such promise .	36

Two of the four big thrifts were sold to NCNB Corp. , Charlotte , N.C. , which has aggressively expanded its markets , particularly in Texas and Florida . A Canadian bank bought another thrift , in the first RTC transaction with a foreign bank .	60
market.n.551	market.n	market	n	But it 's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps . NCNB , for example , has been one of the highest rate payers in the Texas market , and in Florida , rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities . The RTC had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines , but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the agency .	28
market.n.552	market.n	market	n	For example , the delay in selling People 's Heritage Savings , Salina , Kan. , with $ 1.7 billion in assets , has forced the RTC to consider selling off the thrift branch - by - branch , instead of as a whole institution . NCNB continued its foray into the Florida and Texas markets . NCNB will acquire University Federal Savings Association , Houston , which had assets of $ 2.8 billion .	55
market.n.553	market.n	market	n	NCNB Texas National Bank will pay the RTC a premium of $ 129 million for $ 3.5 billion in deposits . As a measure of the depths to which the Texas real estate market has sunk , the RTC will pay $ 3.8 billion to NCNB to take $ 750 million of bad assets .

market.n.561	market.n	market	n	On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday , wheat for December delivery settled at $ 4.0675 a bushel , unchanged . In theory at least , tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply - demand squeeze , said Daniel Basse , a futures analyst with AgResource Co. in Chicago . Such a situation can wreak havoc , as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the Chicago Board of Trade .	35
market.n.562	market.n	market	n	The exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings . Ferruzzi has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market . Unseasonably hot , dry weather across large portions of the Great Plains and in wheat - growing areas in Washington and Oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat crop , said Conrad Leslie , a futures analyst and head of Leslie Analytical in Chicago .	52
market.n.563	market.n	market	n	`` Wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of Soviet demand '' in coming weeks , predicted Richard Feltes , vice president , research , for Refco Inc. in Chicago . Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week : Orange Juice Traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began Friday will go .	35
market.n.564	market.n	market	n	Orange Juice Traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began Friday will go . Late Thursday , after the close of trading , the market received what would normally have been a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the 1989 - 90 Florida orange crop . It was near the low range of estimates , at 130 million 90 - pound boxes , compared with 146.6 million boxes last season .	32
market.n.565	market.n	market	n	Although some analysts look for profit - taking in the wake of Friday 's leap in crude oil prices , last week 's rally is generally expected to continue this week . `` I would continue to look for a stable crude market , at least in futures '' trading , said William Hinton , an energy futures broker with Stotler & Co . Friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets .	42
market.n.566	market.n	market	n	`` I would continue to look for a stable crude market , at least in futures '' trading , said William Hinton , an energy futures broker with Stotler & Co . Friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets . On the New York Mercantile Exchange , West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery finished at $ 20.89 a barrel , up 42 cents on the day .	47
market.n.567	market.n	market	n	On the New York Mercantile Exchange , West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery finished at $ 20.89 a barrel , up 42 cents on the day . On European markets , meanwhile , spot prices of North Sea crudes were up 35 to 75 cents a barrel . `` This market still wants to go higher , '' said Nauman Barakat , a first vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .	30
market.n.568	market.n	market	n	On European markets , meanwhile , spot prices of North Sea crudes were up 35 to 75 cents a barrel . `` This market still wants to go higher , '' said Nauman Barakat , a first vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . He predicted that the November contract will reach $ 21.50 a barrel or more on the New York Mercantile Exchange .	23
market.n.569	market.n	market	n	He predicted that the November contract will reach $ 21.50 a barrel or more on the New York Mercantile Exchange . There has been little news to account for such buoyancy in the oil markets . Analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crudes .	34
market.n.570	market.n	market	n	The minimum unit is $ 100,000 . Typical rates in the secondary market : 8.65 % one month ; 8.65 % three months ; 8.55 % six months .	12
market.n.571	market.n	market	n	The missile venture , the British Aerospace spokeswoman said , is a needed response to the `` new environment '' in defense contracting . For both Thomson and British Aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight - fisted defense ministries ; and Middle East sales , a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports , have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices . The venture 's importance for Thomson is great .	35
market.n.572	market.n	market	n	Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group . Unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the super-rich . Average household income for the sample was $ 194,000 , and average net assets were reported as $ 775,000 .	23
market.n.573	market.n	market	n	Investors who bought stock with borrowed money -- that is , `` on margin '' -- may be more worried than most following Friday 's market drop . That 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans .	25
market.n.574	market.n	market	n	The following were among Friday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report : Dow Chemical Co. --	15
market.n.575	market.n	market	n	$ 500 million of Remic mortgage securities offered in 13 classes by Prudential - Bache Securities Inc . The offering , Series 102 , backed by Freddie Mac 8 1/2 % securities with a weighted average remaining term to maturity of 28.4 years , was priced before the market 's afternoon surge . Among classes for which details were available , yields ranged from 8.78 % , or 75 basis points over two - year Treasury securities , to 10.05 % , or 200 basis points over 10 - year Treasurys .	48
market.n.576	market.n	market	n	Pension funds , insurers and other behemoths of the investing world said they began scooping up stocks during Friday 's market rout . And they plan to buy more today .	20
market.n.577	market.n	market	n	To be sure , big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today . They could still panic and bail out of the market . But their 1987 performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse .	30
market.n.578	market.n	market	n	Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for `` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart . '' He expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further . Denver - based portfolio manager James Craig was n't daunted when Friday 's rout shaved $ 40 million from the value of the $ 752 million Janus Fund he oversees .	28
market.n.579	market.n	market	n	`` I waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through , '' he said . Then he jumped into the market : `` I spent $ 30 million in the last half - hour . ''	23
market.n.580	market.n	market	n	`` There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash . '' Unlike mutual funds , which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money , big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock . Most often , they do just that , because stocks have proved to be the best - performing long - term investment , attracting about $ 1 trillion from pension funds alone .	46
market.n.581	market.n	market	n	Even Friday 's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20 % , well above the annual average for stocks over several decades . `` You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market , '' said James D. Awad , president of New York - based BMI Capital Corp . Mr. Awad , however , worries that the market `` could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days .	38
market.n.582	market.n	market	n	`` You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market , '' said James D. Awad , president of New York - based BMI Capital Corp . Mr. Awad , however , worries that the market `` could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days . It can happen before you can turn around . ''	41
market.n.583	market.n	market	n	In its severest test , the $ 60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n't work , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected . Even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were grim Friday , money managers said . Neil Weisman , whose New York - based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85 % of its $ 220 million investment pool to cash in recent months , said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands .	39
market.n.584	market.n	market	n	Meanwhile , Friday brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally . Especially gleeful were the short sellers , who have been pounded by this year 's market climb . The shorts sell borrowed shares , hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price .	37
market.n.585	market.n	market	n	Or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity , just like Oct. 19 , 1987 , eventually turned out to be ? Here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about Friday 's action , what happens next and what investors should do . Joseph Granville .	26
market.n.586	market.n	market	n	Joseph Granville . `` I 'm the only one who said there would be an October massacre , all through late August and September , '' says Mr. Granville , once a widely followed market guru and still a well - known newsletter writer . `` Everyone will tell you that this time is different from 1987 , '' he says .	34
market.n.587	market.n	market	n	Elaine Garzarelli . A quantitative analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , Ms. Garzarelli had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the 1987 crash . Friday 's big drop , she says , `` was not a crash .	24
market.n.588	market.n	market	n	So she thinks the damage will be short - lived and contained . `` Those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market 10%-12 % down , '' she says . `` This is exactly the same thing , as far as I 'm concerned . ''	24
market.n.589	market.n	market	n	Ned Davis . Friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market , says Mr. Davis , president of Ned Davis Research Inc . But Mr. Davis , whose views are widely respected by money managers , says he expects no 1987 - style crash .	12
market.n.590	market.n	market	n	Over the next several months , though , he says things look bad . `` I think the market will be heading down into November , '' he says . `` We will probably have a year - end rally , and then go down again .	18
market.n.591	market.n	market	n	`` We will probably have a year - end rally , and then go down again . Sort of a two - step bear market . '' He expects the downturn to carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to around 2000 sometime next year .	24
market.n.592	market.n	market	n	He expects the downturn to carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to around 2000 sometime next year . `` That would be a normal bear market , '' he says . `` I guess that 's my forecast . ''	26
market.n.593	market.n	market	n	Leon G. Cooperman . `` I do n't think the market is going through another October '87 . I do n't think that 's the case at all , '' says Mr. Cooperman , a partner at Goldman , Sachs & Co. and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management .	10
market.n.594	market.n	market	n	Mr. Cooperman sees this as a good time to pick up bargains , but he does n't think there 's any need to rush . `` I expect the market to open weaker Monday , but then it should find some stability . '' He ticks off several major differences between now and two years ago .	29
market.n.595	market.n	market	n	These sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so Mr. Gabelli figures they will continue . `` The market was up 35 % since -LCB- President -RCB- Bush took office , '' Mr. Gabelli says , so a correction was to be expected . He thinks another crash is `` unlikely , '' and says he was `` nibbling at '' selected stocks during Friday 's plunge .	27
market.n.596	market.n	market	n	If the dollar stays weak , he says , that will add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. and make it hard for the Federal Reserve Board to ease interest rates very much . Mr. Rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the London and Tokyo markets go . He recommends that investors sell takeover - related stocks , but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities , which often do well during periods of economic weakness .	51
market.n.597	market.n	market	n	And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines , which includes a big stake by British Airways PLC . Some analysts say uncertainty about Washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop . In many ways , the backdrop to Friday 's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987 's 508 - point crash .	54
market.n.598	market.n	market	n	The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy , although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve . And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax - writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous . The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , resulting in a two - year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion during that period .	56
market.n.599	market.n	market	n	The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , resulting in a two - year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion during that period . But , barring further drops in the market this week , a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year . Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit - reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far - reaching than last spring 's gimmick - ridden plan , which still is n't fully implemented .	59
market.n.600	market.n	market	n	Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit - reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far - reaching than last spring 's gimmick - ridden plan , which still is n't fully implemented . One of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that , as everyone learned in 1987 , the economy and the market can survive a one - day 508 - point tumble . `` Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession , '' Rep. Panetta said yesterday in an interview .	86
market.n.601	market.n	market	n	Asked if the administration agreed , he curtly replied : `` The adminstration will have to speak for itself . '' Friday 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit - reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest . Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit .	23
market.n.602	market.n	market	n	Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit . `` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , Sen. Warren Rudman -LRB- R. , N.H . -RRB- . said yesterday . The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm - Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House - passed deficit - reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion .	41
market.n.603	market.n	market	n	`` It 's part of our style , too . '' According to several ad - agency sources , newcomers to the Texas banking market are spending a combined $ 50 million this year to woo Texans .

News of the arrest and charging of the two men helped to push prices on the Singapore Stock market sharply lower in early trading yesterday , but brokers said that the market and CDL shares recovered once it became apparent the charges were limited to the two men personally . One of the two British companies still making hard toilet paper stopped production of it .	42
market.n.608	market.n	market	n	The company did n't elaborate . The diversified energy and minerals concern said that a depressed uranium market is responsible for the temporary mothballing of the plant , but that the plant can be reactivated quickly when the market improves .

market.n.610	market.n	market	n	Dismal sales at General Motors Corp. dragged the U.S. car and truck market down below year - ago levels in early October , the first sales period of the 1990 model year . The eight major domestic auto makers sold 160,510 North American - made cars in the first 10 days of October , a 12.6 % drop from a year earlier .	12
market.n.611	market.n	market	n	Some of the U.S. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models , but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up . `` We 've created a condition where , without incentives , it 's a tough market , '' said Tom Kelly , sales manager for Bill Wink Chevrolet in Dearborn , Mich . Car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 5.8 million vehicles , the lowest since October 1987 .	43
market.n.612	market.n	market	n	To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment , however , the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms . It must also evaluate the real - estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective . Specifically , it must understand how real - estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities .	40
market.n.613	market.n	market	n	It must also evaluate the real - estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective . Specifically , it must understand how real - estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities . When a regional economy catches cold , the local real - estate market gets pneumonia .	27
market.n.614	market.n	market	n	Specifically , it must understand how real - estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities . When a regional economy catches cold , the local real - estate market gets pneumonia . In other words , real - estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , plummet much further than a local economy in recession .	36
market.n.615	market.n	market	n	When a regional economy catches cold , the local real - estate market gets pneumonia . In other words , real - estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , plummet much further than a local economy in recession . This was seen in the late 1960s in Los Angeles and the mid-1970s in New York .	23
market.n.616	market.n	market	n	But the reverse is also true : When a region 's economy rebounds from a slowdown , these real - estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy . Why do local real - estate markets overreact to regional economic cycles ? Because real - estate purchases and leases are such major long - term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth .	37
market.n.617	market.n	market	n	Area employment dropped by 13 % from its 1979 peak and retail sales were down 14 % . However , the real - estate market was hurt even more . For example , residential building permits in the trough year of 1982 were off 76 % from the 1979 peak level .	24
market.n.618	market.n	market	n	Where , savvy corporations and professional firms are now asking , are today 's opportunities ? Look no further than metropolitan Houston and Denver , two of the most depressed , overbuilt and potentially undervalued real - estate markets in the nation . Of course , some observers have touted Houston and Denver for the past five years as a counter-cyclical play .	38
market.n.619	market.n	market	n	In the mid-1980s , employment was down as much as 5 % from the 1982 peak and retail sales were off 13 % . The real - estate market suffered even more severe setbacks . Office construction dropped 97 % .	28
market.n.620	market.n	market	n	To some observers , the empty office buildings of Houston 's `` see - through skyline '' were indicative of a very troubled economy . As usual , the real - estate market had overreacted . Actually , the region 's economy retained a firm foundation .	32
market.n.621	market.n	market	n	And personal income , after slumping in the mid-1980s , has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms . Today , metropolitan Houston 's real - estate market is poised for a significant turnaround . More than 42,000 jobs were added in metro Houston last year , primarily in biotechnology , petrochemical processing , and the computer industry .	29
market.n.622	market.n	market	n	And forecasts project a 2.5 % to 3 % growth rate in jobs over the next few years -- nearly twice the national average . Denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real - estate market has overreacted to the region 's economic trends , although Denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as Houston . By some measures , metropolitan Denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years .	36
market.n.623	market.n	market	n	The rates of increase , however , are less than the rapid growth of the boom years , and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy . In a self - fulfilling prophecy , therefore , the region 's real - estate market all but collapsed in recent years . Housing building permits are down more than 75 % from their 1983 peaks .	46
market.n.624	market.n	market	n	Housing building permits are down more than 75 % from their 1983 peaks . Although no one can predict when metropolitan Denver 's real - estate market will rebound , major public works projects costing several billion dollars are under way or planned -- such as a new convention center , a major beltway encircling the metropolitan area , and a new regional airport . When Denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real - estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound .	26
market.n.625	market.n	market	n	Fed Chairman Greenspan signaled that the central bank was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system to prevent a financial crisis . Other U.S. and foreign officials also mapped out plans , though they kept their moves quiet to avoid making the financial markets more jittery . Friday 's sell - off was triggered by the collapse of UAL 's buy - out plan and a big rise in producer prices .	47

market.n.627	market.n	market	n	Friday 's 190 - point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash , and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly .

market.n.629	market.n	market	n	Friday 's 190 - point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash , and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly . Still , the lesson is about the same : On Friday the 13th , the market was spooked by Washington . The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt .	56
market.n.630	market.n	market	n	The real value of all shares , after all , is directly impacted by the tax on any profits -LRB- all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' -RRB- . And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the House last month . An hour before Friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with $ 5.4 billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut .	43
market.n.631	market.n	market	n	To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of Washington 's sticky fingers . As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course , at some point the market will start to reject them . But the airlines are scarcely a clear case , given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner , who professes to believe safety will be compromised if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes .	38
market.n.632	market.n	market	n	It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion or more . So the UAL deal has problems , and the market loses 190 points . Congratulations , Mr. Secretary and Mr. Congressman .	46
market.n.633	market.n	market	n	Congratulations , Mr. Secretary and Mr. Congressman . In the 1987 crash , remember , the market was shaken by a Danny Rostenkowski proposal to tax takeovers out of existance . Even more important , in our view , was the Treasury 's threat to thrash the dollar .	16
market.n.634	market.n	market	n	In any event , some traders see stocks as underpriced today , unlike 1987 . There is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be cured by a little coherence and common sense in Washington . But on the bearish side , that may be too much to expect .	21
market.n.635	market.n	market	n	Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market meltdown -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet . Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones , making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in October 1987 , if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis .	17
market.n.636	market.n	market	n	And at the Treasury , Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David Mullins carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge . But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters . In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout .	41
market.n.637	market.n	market	n	But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters . In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout . `` The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said one government official , insisting on anonymity .	46
market.n.638	market.n	market	n	Nevertheless , Fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank 's game plan . It is prepared to assume the same role it played in October 1987 , providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat . The Fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions .	37
market.n.639	market.n	market	n	I think that 's less likely .

But with all the money and glamour of high finance come the relentless pressures to do well ; pressure to pull off another million before lunch ; pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second ... '' You need n't be a high - powered securities lawyer to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure .	90
market.n.648	market.n	market	n	The trade figures turn out well , and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price . So much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second .

Seeking to keep Justin 's `` My Own '' product line off the U.S. market , Sony last May filed a suit in Manhattan federal court accusing the upstart of trademark infringement , unfair competition and other violations of business law . Since then , life has changed a lot for 61 - year - old Leonard Kaye , Justin 's owner .	24
market.n.652	market.n	market	n	Justin has been profitable since 1986 , adds the official , who shares his office with numerous teddy bears , all samples from his line of plush toys . Like many others , Mr. Kaye took notice in 1987 when Sony , in a classic example of market segmentation , changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous Walkman line of portable audio equipment and created the My First Sony line for children . The brightly colored new products looked more like toys than the adult models .	47
market.n.653	market.n	market	n	Off and on since then , the companies have skirmished in court . And Justin , in a news release , says , `` Once competitive , Sony now resorts to strong - arm tactics in American courtrooms to carve out and protect niche markets . '' Sony 's lawyer insists that the company 's tactics -- including the use of a private detective posing as a buyer -- are routine in such matters .	44

Still , they long for a `` mega-hit '' toy to excite retail sales in the U.S. , Hong Kong 's biggest market for toys and games . The closest thing the colony 's companies have to a U.S. mega-hit this year is the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of action figures manufactured by Playmates Holdings Ltd .	42
market.n.656	market.n	market	n	Other Hong Kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from 1988 . Besides the lack of a fast - selling product , they cite the continued dominance of the U.S. market by Nintendo Entertainment System , an expensive video game made by Nintendo Co. of Japan . Nintendo buyers have little money left to spend on other products .	34
market.n.657	market.n	market	n	The market for $ 200 billion of high - risk junk bonds , battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines this year , practically vanished Friday . Trading ground to a halt as investors rushed to sell bonds , only to find themselves deserted by potential buyers .	1
market.n.658	market.n	market	n	For example , the price of Southland Corp. 's $ 500 million of 16 3/4 % bonds due 2002 -- sold less than two years ago by Goldman , Sachs & Co. -- plummeted 25 % to just 30 cents on the dollar . But not even Goldman would make a market in the securities of Southland , the owner of the nationwide chain of 7 - 11 convenience stores that is strapped for cash . Goldman officials declined to comment .	51
market.n.659	market.n	market	n	Junk bonds , which mushroomed from less than $ 2 billion at the start of this decade , have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments . The shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp. , which created its U.S. retailing empire with junk financing . Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdales department - store chain up for sale .	38
market.n.660	market.n	market	n	The main catalyst for government bond market rally was the 190.58 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . `` When you get panic in one market , you get flight to quality in the other , '' said Maria Ramirez , money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . Nevertheless , the problems of the junk market could prompt the Federal Reserve to ease credit in the months ahead .	28
market.n.661	market.n	market	n	For the moment , investors seem more preoccupied with the `` bad '' junk than the `` good '' junk . `` The market has been weak since '' the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by Olympia & York , says Mr. Minella of Merrill Lynch . `` That really affected the market in that people started to ask ` What else is in trouble ?

market.n.663	market.n	market	n	Bond prices barely budged until midday . Many bond market participants will be closely eying the action of the Federal Reserve , which might repeat its October 1987 injection of huge amounts of liquidity to buoy the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession . Prices of municipals , investment - grade corporates and mortgage - backed bonds also rose , but lagged behind their Treasury counterparts .	9
market.n.664	market.n	market	n	And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment - grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ 3 billion bond offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority . Despite rumors that the TVA 's long - awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets , sources in the underwriting syndicate said they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled . One of the sources said the smaller portions of $ 750 million each of five - year and 10 - year bonds have already been `` substantially oversubscribed . ''	53
market.n.665	market.n	market	n	Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force , which analyzed the 1987 crash , would be revived -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the Treasury secretary . The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets . But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended .	67

television.n.21	television.n	television	n	The U.S. electronics industry estimates that the HDTV market will total about $ 150 billion over the next two decades , with an additional $ 400 billion expected to go for related products . HDTVs break down images into more than 1,100 lines , compared with 525 for today 's televisions , providing considerably sharper detail . And the sets are wider , resembling the dimensions of a movie screen .	50

television.n.31	television.n	television	n	The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode - ray tube , which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set .

For a program to get into this slot , besides being commercially viable , in the past it also had to be politically correct ."	55
television.n.74	television.n	television	n	Because the government wanted to promote Mandarin , Taiwanese was officially seen as a rustic dialect , and was never eligible for prime time . The three government - run television stations of that era - China Television -LRB- CTV -RRB- , Chinese Television Service -LRB- CTS -RRB- , and Taiwan Television -LRB- TTV -RRB- - had a tacit agreement that they would only show Taiwanese programs at noon or in the 6:30 p.m. time slot , when most viewers would be housewives and elderly people . The programming for these time slots was low-budget , and the subject matter limited to ordinary life in Taiwan 's unsophisticated rural past , mostly tragic tales of mistreated daughters - in - law and the like , or family comedies .	30

campaign.n.28	campaign.n	campaign	n	To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies , voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office . Finally , the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House . Since local benefit - seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress , this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit - seeking than their Democratic counterparts .	71

Peipu residents have taken part enthusiastically in recycling campaigns , flea markets , and post-harvest yam roasts , and events of this nature have even drawn participants from out of town . According to Chiang Yi-sen , when TCAC organized a camping trip last year , participants from Chutung , Toufen , and elsewhere actually outnumbered the locals .	31
campaign.n.60	campaign.n	campaign	n	Most notably , the people of Peipu have begun to sense the value of what they 've got in their community . The campaign to beautify Peipu 's Hsia Street is an excellent case in point . Seven years ago , in order to ease the problem of increasing traffic congestion , the township widened Hsia Street .	23

It might be impossible for Hsia Street to ever be exactly the same as it once was , but the beautification campaign taught the people of Peipu the value of what they have .

campaign.n.99	campaign.n	campaign	n	That session of the Supreme Court and two defeats for Al Gore in Florida courts dominate the news today . We start with the U.S. Supreme Court , specifically at issue , an appeal from the campaign of George W. Bush that the Florida Supreme Court had exceeded its authority when it ruled Florida counties could have more time to hand - count ballots . Throughout an hour and a half of argument , the justices were aggressive in peppering lawyers with questions , and they seemed interested on two issues .	36

campaign.n.104	campaign.n	campaign	n	As this host of legal actions makes its way through the Florida court system , attention is turning to the legal body of last resort in the United States -- the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington . Oral arguments will be heard Friday on a request by the Bush campaign to overturn a decision by Florida 's Supreme Court .

campaign.n.106	campaign.n	campaign	n	President Clinton is questioning the legitimacy of George W. Bush 's election victory . Speaking last night to Democratic supporters in Chicago , the President said Bush won the election only because Republicans stopped the vote - counting in Florida , and Mr. Clinton praised Al Gore 's campaign manager , Bill Daley , for the way he handled the election . I want to thank Bill Daley for his exemplary service as Secretary of Commerce .	48

campaign.n.108	campaign.n	campaign	n	President Bush 's trip to the `` USS Abraham Lincoln '' perhaps one of the chief -- he landed on the aircraft carrier at a speed of about 150 miles an hour and touched down and came to a stop about the space of a football field . He made a nationally televised address last night carried on all of the networks and in an event that undoubtedly has some of the Democrats a little nauseous this morning , the President took what might be a giant first step in his reelection campaign . He talked in the speech about the war on terror , saying , quote it is not over , yet it is not endless , we do n't know the day of final victory , but we have seen the turning of the tide .	92
campaign.n.109	campaign.n	campaign	n	That happens next hour in a summit focusing on an Israeli - Palestinian peace initiative .

He served less than nine years .	33
campaign.n.111	campaign.n	campaign	n	After we 'd finalized all the commercials , and actually done the campaign for them , they hired a new ad agency , and telephone calls just started staggering off .

Good evening to you .	8
campaign.n.115	campaign.n	campaign	n	There are still several polls that say Bush is still ahead in Florida . Bottom line , as we heard David Gregory report , this is not the position the campaign wanted to be in at this stage of the game . Bush 's central message on this bu bus trip across central Florida today was to his diehard supporters telling them go out , tell your friends still on the fence why they need to vote for me , and it 's a message the campaign hopes it was able to convey today , because while Florida is a must - win , they also can not ignore the other battleground states .	30
campaign.n.116	campaign.n	campaign	n	Bottom line , as we heard David Gregory report , this is not the position the campaign wanted to be in at this stage of the game . Bush 's central message on this bu bus trip across central Florida today was to his diehard supporters telling them go out , tell your friends still on the fence why they need to vote for me , and it 's a message the campaign hopes it was able to convey today , because while Florida is a must - win , they also can not ignore the other battleground states . Brian tomorrow morning , Bush flies to Pennsylvania , another swing state with 2023 electoral votes , just two less than Florida .	72
campaign.n.117	campaign.n	campaign	n	He is effectively starting a second campaign for the White House , this one in the court of public opinion . His campaign chairman in Florida with a tough message .	6

campaign.n.119	campaign.n	campaign	n	`` Saturday Night Live '' continuing to set the agenda for campaign coverage .	11
campaign.n.120	campaign.n	campaign	n	Good evening . After an exhausting presidential campaign and 36 long days spent fights over the outcome for President - elect Bush , the real work is just beginning . The time for the transition to the new administration is dramatically reduced .	7
campaign.n.121	campaign.n	campaign	n	Both candidates repeatedly talking about that one issue , but in Florida where there are more than 550 children born every day , families drive the other campaign issues . Polls show education , the environment , and the candidate 's character will influence who voters choose .	27
campaign.n.122	campaign.n	campaign	n	The Republican governor here , Jeb Bush was once expected to deliver his brother this state . The managers of both campaigns saying in the end , the wipper may simply be determined by who gets more people to the voting booth . Kerry Sanders , NBC News , Anaheim .	21
campaign.n.123	campaign.n	campaign	n	She was not at all happy about it . In the first campaign she talked about having to bake cookies . She was n't pleased with that .	12
campaign.n.124	campaign.n	campaign	n	58 % to Rick Lazio 's 41 % . New Yorkers remember the campaign debate where Rick Lazio walked over to Hillary Clinton and said you 're going to sign this pledge about campaign moneys , you 're going to sign it . That .	13
campaign.n.125	campaign.n	campaign	n	Was she attacked unfairly , 68 % did say yes . 57 % went for Clinton , and as for Lazio 's voters , a lot of people said this was a campaign about Hillary Clinton . Rick Lazio is this other guy .	32
campaign.n.126	campaign.n	campaign	n	50 % said we 're voting against her , we 're not voting for Rick Lazio , we 're voting against Senate Hillary , and that shows you that , in fact , as Chris pointed out , she really is a tremendous lightning rod . This campaign was about Hillary Clinton , do you like her or do you not . Scombrort of Hillary Clinton voters were voting for Hillary Clinton , not against Rick Lazio , and on the which one attacked the other more unfairly , the voters said that Lazio attacked Hillary Clinton more unfairly , and that possibly played into the gap in the Jewish vote , which is heavily in favor of Hillary Clinton .	47
campaign.n.127	campaign.n	campaign	n	In addition to the scene that you mentioned , the debate , where Lazio was -- invaded her space , as they say , he hit very hard in the last two weeks on issues involved in the Middle East . The Republican campaign , not directly through Lazio , but others was actually associating in certain ways Mrs. Clinton 's sympathies with the Arab sides in the Middle East with the attack on the battle ship Cole . It got out of hand and so this vote could well be as much a rejection of the Lazio campaign as it is also a very positive setting about Hillary 's numbers , and you remember after Rick Lazio had pressed her right in front of the debate crowd , they said What do you think of this and women said It reminds me of my husband or in some cases my ex-husband and I do n't like it and we see that women and particularly working women went by a large measure for Hillary Clinton , and Lawrence , there is this as well .	43
campaign.n.128	campaign.n	campaign	n	It either says a lot about the '' getting elected in this country or both , but Jay Leno has become a campaign stop in this country . Our report on the new trend from David Gregory .	22
campaign.n.129	campaign.n	campaign	n	The campaign has hit the late show . Both Bush and Al Gore realize there 's votes to be had joking after dark .	1
campaign.n.130	campaign.n	campaign	n	It gives people a chance to show I know how to laugh . Not only laugh with people , I can laugh at myself , which sometimes I need to do during the course of the campaign .	36
campaign.n.131	campaign.n	campaign	n	Here 's a hard - hitting question from Karen . Do you keep your figure during the campaign ?	17
campaign.n.132	campaign.n	campaign	n	Cheney could not be more different . The former cabinet member and oil industry executive so formal and business - like on the campaign trail , critics complain some appearances have all the excitement of a Defense Department briefing .	23
campaign.n.133	campaign.n	campaign	n	What 's the truth ? Are Bush and Gore making campaign promises they ca n't possibly keep ? The nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities did an exhaustive study of the surplus .	10
campaign.n.134	campaign.n	campaign	n	As we heard from David Gregory , one of Governor Bush 's main themes in these last days of the campaign is getting rid of partisan gridlock in Washington , which was exactly what the President was talking about today -- an attempt to reopen debate on a $ 240 billion tax cut plan , saying the version House Republicans passed is unacceptable , because it is unfair , according to the President , to children and seniors .	20
campaign.n.135	campaign.n	campaign	n	While the two campaigns struggle over the outcome of the presidential election , tomorrow , in Washington , a high profile ceremony will be held on the Mall to mark the overdue beginning of a World War II memorial , but not even that moment is without controversy . Here 's Jim Miklaszewski .	3
campaign.n.136	campaign.n	campaign	n	Tom , making it abundantly clear that the Clinton / Gore scandals of the past eight years will be a major theme in the closing days of this campaign , Bush attacks the Vice President for being a failed leader and promises if he 's elected Americans will once again be able to respect their government . Bush campaigns today in this tough battleground state alongside the popular retired general Colin Powell and again hints strongly Powell will be a member of his cabinet if elected .	28
campaign.n.137	campaign.n	campaign	n	Christopher said the recounts should be completed within a matter of days and at that point , Gore campaign sources contend , Gore will be in the lead in Florida and on track to win the election . Meanwhile , Governor George Bush spent the day out of public view , behind the gate of his ranch in Texas , while his point man , James Baker appeared on five network talk shows arguing vigorously that the hand recounts are improper and should be stopped .	18
campaign.n.138	campaign.n	campaign	n	Why ? As Gore considers his options with his family , advisers say he and the campaign realize they are operating on two distinct and delicate tracts -- legal , which they will pursue to keep options open , and political , which they have to watch carefully as they feel mounting pressure . Friends point out that the man who was so quick to concede the first time to George W. Bush when he thought he lost and who told aides , `` we have to do this right , '' is not a politician who would insist on a long , damaging legal process , if it is determined that 's what going to court would mean .	16
campaign.n.139	campaign.n	campaign	n	Today he holds the Bible for her , trading places from when they first came to Washington eight years ago . From the health care fiasco to the Monica humiliation -- I did not have sexual relations with that woman , to the campaign many said she could never win , Hillary Clinton is now the most admired woman in America , beating Oprah by a landslide in the latest Gallup poll . I am thrilled .	43
campaign.n.140	campaign.n	campaign	n	In China a campaign against fake goods has netted 43 million dollars of counterfeit products over the past month . The trade in bogus goods is thought to cost companies tens of billions of dollars in lost revenues each year , but officials say enforcing the law is often dangerous with at least one government inspector killed in recent weeks .	3
campaign.n.141	campaign.n	campaign	n	He also alleged that this is part of a wider plot to undermine both him as well as South Africa 's attempts to obtain a more equitable world economic order . Conspiracy theories aside , the reality is that hundreds of thousands of South Africans are suffering and dying needlessly in vivid contrast to developing nations like Uganda , Thailand and Brazil where the governments have adopted a pro-active role in manufacturing low - cost antiretroviral drugs and are running highly successful AIDS education and condom campaigns . For The World I 'm Carolyn Demster in Johannesburg .	86
campaign.n.142	campaign.n	campaign	n	Given that he has already controlled a majority of the National Assembly , it is very likely that the law will be passed and the general feeling is that there is a hurry in approving the legislation because the President seems to feel that he is running out of time with the popular support he has gotten ever since 1998 . Cuniket says , there has been a lot of public pressure on Chavez to live up to his many campaign promises , such as distributing land and wealth more equally among Venezuelans . Deputies from the opposition are voicing their discontent .	80
campaign.n.143	campaign.n	campaign	n	When Ariel Sharon speaks about his version of peace , I say to you and to the general public , ask yourselves if this so - called peace has a partner on the other side , because if not , this is just a code word for war . Barak 's campaign has been presenting Sharon as a danger to the country 's security . Television ads have portrayed Sharon as a dangerous extremist .	51
campaign.n.144	campaign.n	campaign	n	Television ads have portrayed Sharon as a dangerous extremist . Barak 's campaign has stressed the right wing leader 's role as Minister of Defense during Israel 's disastrous war in Lebanon in the 1980s . Sharon though , has been presenting himself as a moderate and the unifier for the Israeli people .	12
campaign.n.145	campaign.n	campaign	n	Serbia remains tense today in the wake of a massive civil disobedience campaign begun Monday to force President Slobodan Milosevic to concede election defeat . In nearly every Serbian city protestors marched in the streets demanding Mr. Milosevic recognize opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica as the outright winner of last week 's presidential election .	12
campaign.n.146	campaign.n	campaign	n	The paper 's editorial board goes on to say , we believe Mr. Gore would never follow Bill Clinton 's example of reckless conduct that cheapens the Presidency . The Times also praise Republican candidate George W Bush for running what was described as a largely positive inclusive campaign but the writers said they had concluded Mr. Bush 's agenda was harsh on issues such as women 's rights , guns , and law enforcement . The Times joins the Washington Post newspaper , which earlier gave its backing to Mr. Gore .	48
campaign.n.147	campaign.n	campaign	n	I need your help . In the last days of this campaign , I need you all to work your neighborhoods and talk to your friends and turn out to vote .	11
campaign.n.148	campaign.n	campaign	n	A Jerusalem Post poll shows Mr. Sharon 's lead widening to 22 percentage points from 16 points last Friday . Mr. Barak is facing mounting pressure from within his Labor Party to step aside and let elder statesman Shimon Peres run , but he said Wednesday at a campaign rally that no one dare approach him to drop out of the race .	48

assemble.v.5	assemble.v	assemble	v	One thing the President said that will be the point of contention around the world , the President called it an ever - growing coalition of 40 countries . That is handful more nations that were actively involved in the coalition his father assembled 12 years ago for the Persian Gulf War , but there is a significant difference , of course . In this coalition , it is the United States doing the overwhelming load of the fighting .	43

He assembled a group of 25 men , composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation , the company clerk , supply men , cooks and drivers , and led them to the hill . One of the more seriously wounded was Lieutenant Carroll , the young officer bucking for the Regular Army .	11
assemble.v.7	assemble.v	assemble	v	One of Mrs. Kennedy 's initial concerns as First Lady was the sad state of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national shrine . Ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture assembled by President Thomas Jefferson , the White House has collected a hodgepodge of period pieces , few of them authentic or aesthetic . Mrs. Kennedy shows a determination to change all this .	39
assemble.v.8	assemble.v	assemble	v	Dartmouth 's favorite and most characteristic recreation is skiing . Since the days when their two thousand pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the United States , the students have stopped regarding the Olympic Ski Team as another name for their own . Yet Dartmouth still is the dominant member of the Intercollegiate Ski Union , which includes the winter sports colleges of Canada as well as those of this country .	22
assemble.v.9	assemble.v	assemble	v	Strong men with strong opinions , frank to the point of being refreshingly indiscreet , the Founding Seven were essentially congenial minds , and their agreements with each other were more consequential than their differences . Even though in most cases the completion of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off , enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual feats of winning American independence and founding a new nation . Before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary .	60
assemble.v.10	assemble.v	assemble	v	A perceptive journalist , Sam Lubell , has phrased it in the title of one of his books as the revolt of the moderates . He opens his discourse , however , with a review of the Eisenhower inaugural festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents , all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age . The show was colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny .	46
assemble.v.11	assemble.v	assemble	v	For the President had dealt with the matter humbly , in what he conceived as the democratic way . But the problem is one which gives us the measure of a man , rather than a group of men , whether a group of doctors , a group of party members assembled at a dinner to give their opinion , or the masses of the voters . Any attempt to reconcile this statement of the central issue in the campaign of 1956 with the nature of the man who could not conceive it as the central issue will at least resolve our confusions about the chaotic and misleading results of the earnestness of both doctors and President in a situation which should never have arisen .	51

After he had finished the first two volumes of his Lincoln , Sandburg went to work assembling a book of songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the memory of songs others had taught him .

AT&T assembled three of its top executives in Washington , all visibly angry , to try to refute MCI 's charges . `` MCI has made hawks out of the upper echelon of AT&T , '' said PaineWebber 's Mr. Grubman , who said he expected AT&T to become increasingly aggressive in dealing with its longtime nemesis .	21
assemble.v.19	assemble.v	assemble	v	Nearly all the decline came in Ford 's U.S. automotive operations . The Dearborn , Mich. , auto maker ran a loss of $ 37 million on assembling and marketing cars in the U.S. , a deterioration of $ 378 million in that line from the 1988 quarter . Ford managed to show a profit for the quarter primarily because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial services .	27
assemble.v.20	assemble.v	assemble	v	The understatement of growth is due largely to the conservative expedients adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data . The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates -LRB- mainly employment or hours -RRB- instead of output estimates for those sectors , such as governments , paid household services and private non-profit institutions , where there are difficulties in assembling output data . This means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor .	67

When the IAFP recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners , Mr. Gargan 's group was excluded . That may be because Mr. Gargan , smarting at what he considered slurs on his membership standards made by the rival group , enrolled his dog , Beauregard , as a member of the IAFP .	25

At Quotron , the company 's National Call-In Center , which swung into action for the first time last month for Hurricane Hugo , assembled a tactical team at 5 a.m. yesterday to begin rerouting lines and restore service to brokers and traders . The company dispatched as many as 200 people in the San Francisco area to do the work , though most of the rerouting was done by computer .	40

Commodore has assembled an experienced management team , it has persuaded many more dealers to carry its products and it has unleashed a slick advertising campaign . But those represent long-term strategies that probably wo n't succeed quickly , even if they turn out to be the right ones .	40

Director Michael Engler has assembled a top-flight cast to carry out the impersonations of well-known political figures and to play the stock characters who invariably show up at congressional hearings . Daniel von Bargen is ramrod-stiff but totally assured as Major Battle , mixing just the right brand of self-righteousness and patriotism ; Jeff Weiss is fire , brimstone and teary-eyed emotionalism as the far-right senator who serves as a friendly interrogator of Major Battle ; Zach Grenier is maddeningly officious playing a succession of lawyers ; Joseph Daly has the perfect `` aw , shucks '' demeanor of George Bush in his portrayal of the vice president ; and Ann McDonough is first-rate as a succession of witnesses ' wives .	28

assemble.v.30	assemble.v	assemble	v	Cementing such relationships with major clients -- car and appliance makers -- is a means of survival , especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and flirting with plastic and aluminum makers . For example , when Detroit began talking about plastic-bodied cars , the American Iron and Steel Institute began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by simply redesigning how a car door is assembled . But steelmakers must also find new markets .	80

Each chariot is assembled from over 7,000 different pieces , and is half the size of the original , which has been described as "" the most extraordinary bronze piece ever made "" on account of its huge size , complex structure , and lifelike realism .

root.v.2	root.v	root	v	The liberal-conservative division , we might observe in passing , is not of itself directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle between ruling groups .

root.v.3	root.v	root	v	At that point men become aware of the mystery of history called variously `` fate '' , or `` destiny '' , or `` providence '' , and feel themselves caught helplessly in the writhing of a disrupted society .

root.v.4	root.v	root	v	The content of that psychological status determines , ultimately , the content of civilization .

Gorky was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed to enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of Chekhovian humanism .

root.v.16	root.v	root	v	In fact , Kazuo Ishiguro 's `` The Remains of the Day '' -LRB- Knopf , 245 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- is both an homage to traditional English forms and a dramatic critique of them . It implies that the British Empire was rooted in its subjects ' minds , manners and morals , and argues , tacitly , that its self-destructive flaws were embodied in the defensive snobbery , willful blindness , role-playing and especially the locutions of its domestic servants . As the narrator Stevens , the solitary butler of Darlington Hall , mulls over such hallowed terms as `` greatness , '' `` dignity , '' `` service '' and `` loyalty , '' we see how pious cant subverts the soul .	44

reveal.v.13	reveal.v	reveal	v	It was there , in the course of trying to prepare new men for the `` culture shock '' they might encounter in remote overseas posts , that he first began to develop a system of charting the `` norms of human communication '' . To the trained ear of the linguist , talk has always revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker -- such things as geographical origin and history , socio-economic identity , education . It is only fairly recently , however , that linguists have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people .	56
reveal.v.14	reveal.v	reveal	v	An accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp . With this seven-word sentence -- though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food -- he was telling things about himself and , in the last two examples , revealing that he had departed from the customs of his culture . The joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry have established , in point of fact , that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are involved , it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate to the rest of the world .	51
reveal.v.15	reveal.v	reveal	v	In one now-historic first interview , for example , the transcript -LRB- reproduced from the book , The First Five Minutes -RRB- goes like this : The therapist 's level tone is bland and neutral -- he has , for example , avoided stressing `` you '' , which would imply disapproval ; ; or surprise , which would set the patient apart from other people . The patient , on the other hand , is far from neutral ; ; aside from her specifically regional accent , she reveals by the use of the triad , `` irritable , tense , depressed '' , a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language -LRB- i.e. , she must have had at least a high-school education -RRB- , and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before . Then she catapults into `` everything and everybody '' , putting particular violence on `` everybody '' , indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag -- that is , it is not congruent to the patient 's general style of speech up to this point .	89
reveal.v.16	reveal.v	reveal	v	The linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence ; ; so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce . By saying `` another emotional death '' , she reveals that there has been a previous one , although she has not described it in words . This the therapist may pursue in later questioning .	39
reveal.v.17	reveal.v	reveal	v	Interestingly enough -- although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman -- when groups of them began playing back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques ; ; almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again . Yet , in spite of this , intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what 's wrong with him ; ; to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen . Naturally , the patient does not say , `` I hate my father '' , or `` Sibling rivalry is what bugs me '' .	107
reveal.v.18	reveal.v	reveal	v	So wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from North Country School , Lake Placid , New York . In this one sentence , he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school . Because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value , care for its origin , and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients , the food does taste good .	31
reveal.v.19	reveal.v	reveal	v	Such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had `` never seen her entirely naked '' , while another woman , boasting an equal number of years of married life , is proud of having `` shared the nudist way of life -- the really free , natural nude life -- for most of that period '' . Attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions .

Owing to the restrained usages characteristic of 19th-century America , these letters usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling . Occasionally gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits in Richmond , Petersburg , Washington , or Nashville .	26
reveal.v.21	reveal.v	reveal	v	The one way to get around them -- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking to it -- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money . Only then , perhaps , will he reveal his jewels and his bargains . Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served .	53
reveal.v.22	reveal.v	reveal	v	Thus , Sauternes or Barsacs should be very cold ; ; a Pouilly-Fuisse or a Chablis somewhat less cold . Over-chilling is an accepted method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white wine , especially a dry wine -- and certainly less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive . The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air .	58
reveal.v.23	reveal.v	reveal	v	At that time Jennings had a young law associate named Arthur S. Phillips . A few years ago , not too long before his death , Phillips revealed in a newspaper story that he had always suspected Morse of the murders . He said Morse and Borden had quarreled violently in the house that day , information which must have come from Lizzie .	27
reveal.v.24	reveal.v	reveal	v	Also Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which one could make the most words from the letters in `` importunately '' . Who won is not revealed , but Winslow 's daughter Eleanor says they got up to 1,212 words . There was another family interest also .	29
reveal.v.25	reveal.v	reveal	v	If internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality , then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism . Reference to two other concepts -- nationalism and sovereignty -- may help to reveal the contours of the new principle . In its beginnings the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself -- internally , against feudal groups , and externally , against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church .	36
reveal.v.26	reveal.v	reveal	v	They are mere fragments , just one portion of preprepared messages . What these fragments are and how they activate the go order may not be revealed . The pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by Wisman 's staff .	26
reveal.v.27	reveal.v	reveal	v	He has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for Mr. Cunningham 's Summerspace , so that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity . For Mr. Taylor 's Images And Reflections she made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer , and a girl 's cape lined with grass . Mr. Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor .	47
reveal.v.28	reveal.v	reveal	v	The resulting picture might appear a maze of restless confusions and contradictions , but it is more true to life than a portrait of an artificially contrived order . The contemporary painter tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines , colors , masses , and energies . He is still concerned , however , with a personal event .	46
reveal.v.29	reveal.v	reveal	v	The mind has betrayed them , reason is the foe of life ; ; they will trust only their physical sensations , the wisdom of the body , the holy promptings of the unconscious . With lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate , but their faith in love , inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz , culminates in the climax of the orgasm . Their work mirrors the mentality of the psychopath , rootless and irresponsible .	39
reveal.v.30	reveal.v	reveal	v	Lautner , for his part , `` belonged to the present-day race of small artists , who do not demand the utmost of themselves '' , and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as `` wretched little poseurs '' , the devastating indictment `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in order '' , and the somewhat extreme prophecy , so far not fulfilled : `` They will be destroyed '' . The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as well . His appearance as Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience ; ; it is a spectacle absolutely painful , an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit , untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation .	86
reveal.v.31	reveal.v	reveal	v	And this occurs now , at the refrain of Jacoby 's song -- at the point , in fact , of the name `` Lizzy '' -- ; ; a modulation described as `` almost a stroke of genius '' . `` A miracle , a revelation , it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude '' . It is this modulation which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and , simultaneously , his wife 's infidelity .	46
reveal.v.32	reveal.v	reveal	v	`` A miracle , a revelation , it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude '' . It is this modulation which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and , simultaneously , his wife 's infidelity . By the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience ; ; he collapses , and dies .	26
reveal.v.33	reveal.v	reveal	v	Instead it means that the thinking in which decision issues has the power to determine the morality of the decision , as in this instance the pressure for renewed practical or legislative attention to the constitutional problems the decision had uncovered might have done . Drifting through a third illness , apparently without any provision for the handling of a major national emergency other than a talk with the vice-president , Eisenhower revealed the singularly static quality of his thinking . Despite three warnings , no sense of moral urgency impelled him to distinguish his situation , and thus his responsibilities , from Wilson 's .	72
reveal.v.34	reveal.v	reveal	v	Mann understood better than most men the incest comedy at the center of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread is shown as the other face as longing was for him just the kind of deep and complicated joke he liked to tell . And when he retold the legend of Gregorius he interpolated a modern version in which the medieval players speak contemporary thoughts in archaic language ; ; while they move through the pageantry of the ancient incest myth and cover themselves through not-knowing , they reveal the unconscious motive in seeking each other and in the last scene make an extraordinary confession of guilt in the twentieth-century manner . Grigorss is the child of an incestuous union between a royal brother and sister , the twins Sibylla and Wiligis .	90
reveal.v.35	reveal.v	reveal	v	Grigorss overcomes the suitor in battle , delivers the city from its oppressors and marries Sibylla who had fallen in love with the beautiful knight the moment she saw him . Sibylla is pregnant with their second child when she finds the ivory tablet concealed by her husband , and the identities of mother and son are revealed . Grigorss goes off to do penance on a rock for seventeen years .	57
reveal.v.36	reveal.v	reveal	v	He and also Mr. Cowley and Mr. Warren have fallen to the temptation which besets many of us to read into our authors -- Nathaniel Hawthorne , for example , and Herman Melville -- protests against modernism , material progress , and science which are genuine protests of our own but may not have been theirs . Faulkner 's total works today , and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when Mr. Cowley made his comment , or in 1939 , when Mr. O'Donnell wrote his essay , reveal no such simple attitude toward the South . If he is a traditionalist , he is an eclectic traditionalist .	92

reveal.v.39	reveal.v	reveal	v	He asked to be appointed a preacher . But Michael Sept had unmasked him , revealing he had never been a bishop , but was an Anabaptist , afraid to state his faith , because he knew John Calvin had written a book against their belief that the soul slept after death . So John had refused to agree to his appointment as a preacher , and now Caroli sought revenge .	15

reveal.v.42	reveal.v	reveal	v	A bold line of violet broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains , followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky . The wan light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies . They had been seen as soon as they left the ranch , picked out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees .	39
reveal.v.43	reveal.v	reveal	v	They greeted the news angrily , as though they had been cheated of purpose . Lester heard their muttering , saw their eyes reveal their desire . He worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat , dry and cracked .	23
reveal.v.44	reveal.v	reveal	v	He spoke to me in a gruff voice , an affectation which quite belied his personality . He wore his white shirt open at the neck , revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest underneath . It was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was .	27
reveal.v.45	reveal.v	reveal	v	But he brought back the sheriff and several deputies , and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the Lewis killing . A detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman 's hiding place . There were no tracks of either hoofs or boots .	32
reveal.v.46	reveal.v	reveal	v	He was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder , with Gansevoort and Heiser behind him . A glance revealed that the main topgallant mast had been carried away . The aimless milling about of what had been a well-trained , well-organized crew struck Alexander with horror .	24
reveal.v.47	reveal.v	reveal	v	But those penetrating eyes -- I had to turn my head away . It was then that I saw what the drawn-back covers revealed . There were bloodspots on the sheet .	23
reveal.v.48	reveal.v	reveal	v	The smooth curve of her neck , very white against hair which curled against it like petals . Her hair was the color of those blooms which in seed catalogues are referred to as `` black '' , but since no flower is actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple or blue -- he wanted to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers , searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness . So he sought her out , and spoke to her , and thought of his hand in her hair .	80

An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 -LRB- when control of that body changed party hands -RRB- , moreover , reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise , due to their majority-party status , over other resources such as committee staff . An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state -LRB- a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder -RRB- .	67

Operating as a one man police force in fact if not in name , he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves .

But while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization -LRB- so cumbersome it can not constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo -RRB- , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as a whole . So we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation 's needs for survival .	82
operate.v.33	operate.v	operate	v	The corporation has a limited , specific place in our society . Ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society . Examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by any means other than the corporate form , e.g. constructing major airports or dams .	20

frame.v.16	frame.v	frame	v	I had underestimated , however , both Mr. Gelbart 's wit and the persistence of scandal in Washington . Though the play clearly is framed around the events of Iran-Contra , it takes in the wide sweep of scandals over the past 30 years .

In this light , the comparative advantages of legislative law-making become clear : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Before it acts , the legislature typically will hear the views of representatives of all those affected by its decision , not just the immediate parties before the court ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the legislature can frame `` bright line '' standards that create less uncertainty than the fact-bound decisions of courts . Although legislative lines can result in under-inclusion -LRB- which explains why the SEC has long resisted a legislative definition of insider trading -RRB- , judicial lawmaking inevitably creates uncertainty because of the shadowy outer edges and implications of most judicial decisions .	72

assert.v.3	assert.v	assert	v	Of course , there remain many `` old-fashioned '' marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy . Yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are asserting themselves more strongly . The meekest , most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother 's or grandmother 's standards .	29
assert.v.4	assert.v	assert	v	Our society has `` emancipated '' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority . It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role . `` The sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum '' , declares Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone , medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and author of the recent book , Release From Sexual Tensions .	23
assert.v.5	assert.v	assert	v	Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage . Hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area . More often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home .	19
assert.v.6	assert.v	assert	v	When was the turning point ? ? When did women begin to assert themselves sexually ? ? Some date it from woman suffrage , others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin .	12

assert.v.8	assert.v	assert	v	Another teen-ager remarked : `` Most Jews do n't believe in God , but they believe in people -- in helping people '' . Still another boy asserted : `` To be a good Jew is to do no wrong ; ; it 's to be a good person '' . When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant , the boy answered , `` It 's the same thing '' .	27
assert.v.9	assert.v	assert	v	By prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men , the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders . Outside those limits it asserted , as against other states , a position of sovereign equality , and , as against the `` inferior '' peoples of the non-Western world , a position of dominance . It became the sole `` subject '' of `` international law '' -LRB- a term which , it is pertinent to remember , was coined by Bentham -RRB- , a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what Western nations could do in the world arena .	30
assert.v.10	assert.v	assert	v	The Rule of Law , historically a principle according everyone his `` day in court '' before an impartial tribunal , was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare . Recognizing that the Rule of Law is `` a dynamic concept which should be employed not only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society '' , the Congress asserted that it also included the responsibility `` to establish social , economic , educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized '' . The idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the non-Soviet world .	71
assert.v.11	assert.v	assert	v	Reference to two other concepts -- nationalism and sovereignty -- may help to reveal the contours of the new principle . In its beginnings the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself -- internally , against feudal groups , and externally , against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church . The breakup of the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall of feudalism led , not more than two centuries ago , to the surge of nationalism .	30
assert.v.12	assert.v	assert	v	All seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality . John Adams asserted in the Continental Congress ' Declaration of Rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their charters , the British Constitution and the common law , and Jefferson appealed in the Declaration of Independence `` to the tribunal of the world '' for support of a revolution justified by `` the laws of nature and of nature 's God '' . They fought hard , but they were forgiving to former foes , and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscating Tory property in violation of the Treaty of 1783 .	19
assert.v.13	assert.v	assert	v	Many believe -- and understandably -- that the great difference between the Constitution of the Southern Confederacy and the Federal Constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to secede . But though each of its members had asserted this right against the Union , the final Constitution which the Confederacy signed on March 11 -- nearly a month before hostilities began -- included no explicit provision authorizing a state to secede . Its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their Constitution .	41
assert.v.14	assert.v	assert	v	One is tempted to say that , on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles , the worst war of the Nineteenth century was fought . But though the Southern States , when drafting a constitution to unite themselves , narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede , the fact remained that by seceding from the Union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states . If the Union conceded this to them , the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede : This would destroy the federal balance between it and the states , and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their Union .	54
assert.v.15	assert.v	assert	v	His ideal was Alexander of Macedon , as Napoleon 's was Julius Caesar . His purpose , however , was not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice . Each aspired to be a god in human form , but with each it was a different kind of god .	28
assert.v.16	assert.v	assert	v	Some of us might be inclined to argue , in fact , that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation , either mental or physical , are particularly Southern traits . There is no necessity , I suppose , to assert that Mr. Faulkner is Southern . It would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly Southern pedigree than that of his family .	44
assert.v.17	assert.v	assert	v	The Agreeable Autocracies is an attempt to explore some of the institutions which both reflect and determine the character of the free society today . The men who speculate on these institutions have , for the most part , come to at least one common conclusion : that many of the great enterprises and associations around which our democracy is formed are in themselves autocratic in nature , and possessed of power which can be used to frustrate the citizen who is trying to assert his individuality in the modern world '' . These institutions which Mr. Lyford names `` agreeable autocracies '' -- where did they come from ? ?	84

assert.v.19	assert.v	assert	v	By 1987 , then-Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II . If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded , the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable . The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power .	67
assert.v.20	assert.v	assert	v	One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers . There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills . If Congress does nothing , President Bush will have won .	46
assert.v.21	assert.v	assert	v	There still are some details to be nailed down . Mr. Bush is reserving the right in `` rare '' instances to keep Congress in the dark , asserting a constitutional prerogative the committee does n't recognize . And a pending Justice Department interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled .	28
assert.v.22	assert.v	assert	v	He has argued that such presidential power is necessary to rein in congressional spending . But some analysts , particularly conservative legal scholars , have urged Mr. Bush not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to assert that the Constitution already implicitly gives him the power to exercise a line-item veto . Such an assertion most likely would bring about a court challenge from Congress that would clarify whether a president already has such power .	37
assert.v.23	assert.v	assert	v	The claims , which were filed with the State Board of Control but will probably end up in court , are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called Cypress structure viaduct . The men can defeat immunities that states often assert in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes . A Board of Control spokesman said the board had not seen the claim and declined to comment .	43
assert.v.24	assert.v	assert	v	The government 's startling allegations , filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal overcharge trial against GE in Philadelphia federal district court , challenge the motives and veracity of the nation 's third-largest defense contractor . In a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday , GE asserted that `` prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses , distorted documents and ignored important facts . '' The company attacked the government 's allegations as `` reckless and baseless mudslinging , '' and said its management `` promptly and accurately reported '' to the Pentagon all relevant information about billing practices .	55
assert.v.25	assert.v	assert	v	When GE finally disclosed the problems , prosecutors contend that Mr. Orr `` was erroneously informed that the -LCB- suspected -RCB- practices had only just been discovered '' by GE management . In its brief , the government asserted that it needs the internal GE documents to rebut anticipated efforts by GE during the trial to demonstrate `` its good corporate character . '' GE , which was surprised by the last-minute subpoena for more than 100 boxes and file cabinets of documents , countered that senior GE managers did n't find out about questionable billing practices until 1985 , and that the information was passed on quickly to Mr. Orr at his first meeting with company representatives .	38
assert.v.26	assert.v	assert	v	GE 's filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity . The company 's conduct `` does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent , ratification or cover-up , '' GE 's brief asserts . `` On the contrary , it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters .

As of last weekend , a dozen labs also have reported measuring `` excess '' heat from similar electrolytic experiments , although amounts of such heat vary widely .	45
assert.v.31	assert.v	assert	v	President Bush called his attention to the matter during the Italian leader 's visit here last week . Olivetti has denied that it violated Cocom rules , asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the Italian authorities .

assert.v.32	assert.v	assert	v	Parsippany , N.J . I disagree with the statement by Mr. Lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former HUD officials who assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in congressional hearings . The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself . ''	25
assert.v.33	assert.v	assert	v	Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify . Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime .	21

Taiwan has improved its standing with the U.S. by initialing a bilateral copyright agreement , amending its trademark law and introducing legislation to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films .

Nissan says it will introduce its first system next month on the Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan , and Toyota 's Celica coupe will go on sale with the suspension device next spring . But drivers in the U.S. must wait : The Japanese , for now , are keeping active suspension for domestic use only .	26
introduce.v.47	introduce.v	introduce	v	Their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital-gains cut , which has had a roller-coaster existence since the beginning of the year , when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the House . Nevertheless , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , last night introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure authorizing U.S. aid for Poland and Hungary . Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- was confident he had enough votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds , perhaps as soon as today .	63
introduce.v.48	introduce.v	introduce	v	Concerned with the increased availability of surveillance technology and heavier use of it , lawmakers have proposed laws addressing the issue . Nine states have introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made aware of monitoring . And four states -- California , Florida , Michigan and Pennsylvania -- have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded .	25
introduce.v.49	introduce.v	introduce	v	Two bills in Congress hope to make such restrictions national . In May , Rep. Don Edwards -LRB- D. Calif . -RRB- introduced congressional legislation that would require an audible beeping during any employee monitoring , warning people that they are being heard . -LRB- The legislation is similar to a 1987 `` beeper bill '' that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry . -RRB-	22

introduce.v.51	introduce.v	introduce	v	American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled new optical transmission systems for data , video and voice communications . Two products in what the telecommunications giant called a new generation of such equipment are available now , AT&T said , and three others will be introduced in 1990 and 1991 . The products are aimed at a market expected to total more than $ 1 billion a year in sales by 1995 , said Morgan Buchner Jr. , vice president of transmission systems for AT&T .	44
introduce.v.52	introduce.v	introduce	v	This cuts down greatly on labor , Mr. Buchner said . To be introduced later are a multiplexer , which will allow several signals to travel along a single optical line ; a light-wave system , which carries voice channels ; and a network controller , which directs data flow through cross-connect systems . AT&T said the products , unlike previous generations , will meet so-called Sonet compatability standards , which AT&T expects to be broadly adopted .	13
introduce.v.53	introduce.v	introduce	v	But the bill was passed without debate in the Diet , in the absence of the opposition . As a result , the Japanese people did n't know what to expect when the new law was introduced on April 1 . They were frustrated by the longer queues at the cashier and the small coins given as change .	36
introduce.v.54	introduce.v	introduce	v	The margin of error for subgroups -- for example , married women with children at home -- would be larger . In addition , in any survey , there is always the chance that other factors such as question wording could introduce errors into the findings . -LRB- See related story : `` The American Way of Buying : Is Buying a Car a Choice or a Chore ? --	41
introduce.v.55	introduce.v	introduce	v	In addition , the company has made it tough on competitors by offering a stream of desktop computers at sharply lower prices . A year ago , Silicon Graphics introduced a model priced at $ 15,000 -- almost as cheap as mainstream workstations that do n't offer special graphics features . Silicon Graphics also plans to unveil even less expensive machines in the near future .	29
introduce.v.56	introduce.v	introduce	v	Maybe we should ask why it was that Du Pont so quickly capitulated and issued a statement , giving it wide publicity , that it was withdrawing CFCs . Freon , introduced in 1930 , revolutionized America by making refrigeration and air conditioning practical after all . One answer is that big companies are growing weary of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them , although they never care to put it quite that way .	31
introduce.v.57	introduce.v	introduce	v	And the Poles are engaged in commerce . '' But the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that Poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce smelter pollution , or that the Soviets plan to introduce marketable pollution permits in some republics next year . Those implications include : -- Privatization .	44
introduce.v.58	introduce.v	introduce	v	Finally , the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services . In 1985 , a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced , and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed . Since then , further research argues that failure to take account of quality improvements has contributed a total of at least 0.26 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate .	37

About 200,000 East Germans marched in Leipzig and thousands more staged protests in three other cities in a fresh challenge to the Communist leadership to introduce democratic freedoms . In an East Berlin suburb , meanwhile , employees at an electronics plant formed an independent trade union called Reform , a worker spokesman said .	49

One proposal is to introduce a new payment system for parking in Paris . Instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines , which deliver little paper receipts , drivers would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops .	22
introduce.v.66	introduce.v	introduce	v	While Seita retains a manufacturing monopoly in France , it is being hurt by rising imports and from waning cigarette demand . So Seita has introduced blonde cigarettes under the Gauloises label , and intends to relaunch the unsuccessful Gitanes Blondes in new packaging , similar to the slide-packs used by brown-tobacco Gitanes . The aim , says Mr. de Galle , is to win market share from imported cigarettes , and to persuade smokers who are switching to blonde cigarettes to keep buying French .	25

introduce.v.71	introduce.v	introduce	v	Gingerly , some economists began to blame central planning . Some writers in theoretical journals even raised the notion of introducing democracy , at least in the workplace . By summer , an independent reform movement was saying out loud what it had only whispered before .	20
introduce.v.72	introduce.v	introduce	v	It also marks P&G 's growing concern that its Japanese rivals , such as Kao Corp. , may bring their superconcentrates to the U.S. . The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent , called Attack , which quickly won a 30 % stake in the Japanese markets . `` They do n't want to get caught again , '' says one industry watcher .	38
introduce.v.73	introduce.v	introduce	v	Superconcentrates are n't entirely new for P&G . The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack . When Attack hit the shelves in 1987 , P&G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % .	10
introduce.v.74	introduce.v	introduce	v	Then retailers `` will probably push the -LCB- less-established -RCB- brands out altogether , '' he says . Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S. .

He figured his best bet was a call on the sheriff . A clerk in the outer office took him in to Sheriff Carruthers , a big , paunchy man with thick , white hair and a voice with a senatorial resonance which suggested he should be running for higher office .	44
figure.v.23	figure.v	figure	v	`` Hey , come back '' , he shouted . He thought it must be some damn janitor or cleaning woman puttering around , figuring that Hirey had gone off and forgotten to turn off everything and lock up . Then the faint beginnings of fear stirred in his mind .	24

I once trained a horse for Hoot Gibson , but nothing like Sparky .	17
figure.v.37	figure.v	figure	v	And most of all it is not having the only man you could love , whether he drives a bread truck or delivers the mail or checks the berry crates down at the sheds , or owns seventeen oil wells and six diamond mines , for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the one . He can even be a mild-voiced little-town guy with big-town ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even Houdini could n't figure out , how it is unlocked . And he can be on the way to Memphis , your Gratt Shafer can , and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it means you want him -- really want him -- dead .	86
figure.v.38	figure.v	figure	v	I got her into bed , and sat with her until she had sobbed herself out . It was three o'clock before I figured it was all right to go . I left her , a limp bundle of self-pity , shivering with terror because her bubble had burst around her .	23

figure.v.40	figure.v	figure	v	I 'd never even petted with a boy , and after I met Johnnie he never touched me for the longest while , not until I all but threw myself at him . He was plenty attentive , all right , but he behaved like a gentleman , and I figured that , emotionally , I was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half .

figure.v.52	figure.v	figure	v	`` I think program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor , '' says Leo Fields , a Dallas investor . He notes that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades , that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading . But he blames program trading for only some of the market 's volatility .	56

figure.v.56	figure.v	figure	v	In the last hour of the trading day , December contract took a tumble to end the session 10 cents lower at $ 19.62 a barrel . And now that the price has fallen below $ 19.65 , which many had said showed considerable resistance , some traders and analysts figure there 's little to stop the price from going lower on technical decisions . With no petroleum-related news or changes in the fundamentals to dictate price moves , `` technicians are wanting to sell this stuff , '' said Eric Bolling of Edge Trading Corp .	50
figure.v.57	figure.v	figure	v	`` The Caterpillar people are n't too happy when they see their equipment used like that , '' shrugs Mr. George . `` They figure it 's not a very good advert .

figure.v.58	figure.v	figure	v	The U.S. government 's Sverdlovsk complaint , as with Krasnoyarsk , is no mere political posturing . Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate , and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the U.S. government . But the stated U.S. position is detailed and specific , and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling .	21

Now , the 55-year-old car shopper is zeroing in on a full-sized van , figuring that it 's just the thing to haul nine grandchildren and pull a boat at the same time . `` That seems to be what all my friends are using to take the grandkids to the lake , '' she says .	33
figure.v.60	figure.v	figure	v	But the scandal itself is so convoluted that ruling-party members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of undermining the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone . `` The opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the LDP is that kind of beast , '' says Shigezo Hayasaka , former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst . But , he adds , `` We ca n't tell where it will go at all because we 're still in the middle of it . ''	46

figure.v.64	figure.v	figure	v	A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years . `` It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem , '' says Kathryn McGrath , director of the SEC 's division of investment management . So the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded , self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers , which operates in the brokerage business .	20
figure.v.65	figure.v	figure	v	That wo n't matter if they are held to maturity , but if , for any reason , the parents need to sell them before then , there could be a severe loss of principal . Had zeros been available in 1972 and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years ' tuition at the time , aiming for their children 's 1988 enrollment , they would have been left with only enough to pay for two years , Mr. Anderson figures . Most other bonds , however , would probably not have fared much better .	83

I compared one universal policy for $ 130,000 face amount from such an insurer , American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln , Neb. , with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. , which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen .	57

But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it . If anti-Semitism was on trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department of Jewish Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as well as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? ?	63

What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable Anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute ? ?

He stated on 14 February that he once made a risk assessment for nuclear power in Taiwan , taking into consideration the island 's population density , its level of nuclear technology and its level of economic development , and concluded that it was not worth the risk . But since it would appear from public opinion polls that the majority in Taiwan believe that for economic reasons the plant should still be built , he could only hope that construction standards will be strictly adhered to , and that no accident will ever occur at the plant .	68

The stay was granted to give the school districts involved in the initial cases 90 days to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court here in Washington . The appeals court ruled last summer , but the phrase under God which was added to the pledge in the 1950s is an unconstitutional endorsement of religion .	35

appeal.v.22	appeal.v	appeal	v	All seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality . John Adams asserted in the Continental Congress ' Declaration of Rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their charters , the British Constitution and the common law , and Jefferson appealed in the Declaration of Independence `` to the tribunal of the world '' for support of a revolution justified by `` the laws of nature and of nature 's God '' . They fought hard , but they were forgiving to former foes , and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscating Tory property in violation of the Treaty of 1783 .	51
appeal.v.23	appeal.v	appeal	v	Since 1954 the Negro 's desire for social justice has led to an ironically anarchical rebellion . He has frequently refused to move from white lunch counters , refused to obey local laws which he considers unjust , while in other cases he has appealed to federal laws . This bold self-assertion , after decades of humble subservience , is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon , an abrupt change in the Southern way of existence .	44
appeal.v.24	appeal.v	appeal	v	Others , less consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times , experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet , painter , and musician . An approach that has appealed to some choreographers is reminiscent of Charles Olson 's statement of the process of projective verse : `` one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception '' . The creator trusts his intuition to lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors the reality of his experience .	35
appeal.v.25	appeal.v	appeal	v	An inmate , a former university professor , expounded to us , logically and clearly , that someone was pilfering his thoughts .

appeal.v.26	appeal.v	appeal	v	The animosity expressed by such a scene had the penetrating quality of a natural force ; ; and it gave Miriam Noel a fund of energy like that of a person inspired to complete some great and universal work of art . As if to make certain that Wright would be unable to pay any settlement at all , Miriam wrote to prospective clients denouncing him ; ; she also went to Washington and appealed to Senator George William Norris of Nebraska , the Fighting Liberal , from whose office a sympathetic but cautious harrumphing was heard . Then , after overtures to accept a settlement and go through with a divorce , Miriam gave a ghastly echo of Mrs. Micawber by suddenly stating , `` I will never leave Mr. Wright '' .	74

The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman . Lithe and muscular , he had well-molded features , and his light color told of the European ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family .	51
appeal.v.30	appeal.v	appeal	v	`` You were right '' , he said -- `` you and your engineer -- and I 'm in something of a bind . Freddy 's solution does n't appeal to me . In addition to other defects , I 'm a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment .	29
appeal.v.31	appeal.v	appeal	v	The litigation was costly and seemingly endless . I fought like a tigress but by the time I appealed my case to the Supreme Court -LRB- 1937 -RRB- , Mr. Roosevelt and his `` henchmen '' had done their `` dirty work '' all too well , even going so far as to attempt to `` pack '' the highest tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me . Presidential coercion had succeeded not only in poisoning the courtiers , `` toadies '' and sycophants of the `` bench '' against me , but it had been so far-reaching as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing me ! !	18
appeal.v.32	appeal.v	appeal	v	Alarmed councilors say the project could jeopardize costly efforts to stop , or slow down , the subsidence that makes Venice subject to regular and destructive flooding . The council unanimously opposed the idea of AGIP pumping out the methane gas and swiftly appealed to the company and to Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti , who has yet to reply . AGIP refused to reconsider and says drilling is due to start early next year .	43
appeal.v.33	appeal.v	appeal	v	Logic plays a minimal role here . More important are what LSI calls `` psychological anchors '' -- a few focal points calculated to appeal to the jury on a gut level . In one personal-injury case , a woman claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a pool , but the fall did n't explain why one of her arms was discolored bluish .	24
appeal.v.34	appeal.v	appeal	v	The murderer , Ronald Gene Simmons , was convicted of killing 14 people . Another murderer on death row has appealed Mr. Simmons 's death sentence in a `` next friend '' capacity . Wilmer Cutler 's brief argues that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences and that the inmate who filed the appeal lacks proper standing .	20
appeal.v.35	appeal.v	appeal	v	That 's true of only 14 % of households headed by someone 60 or older . Generally , imports appeal most to Americans who live in the West and are well-educated , affluent and , especially , young . `` For many baby boomers , buying a domestic car is a totally foreign experience , '' says Christopher Cedergren , auto-market analyst with J.D. Power & Co. of Agoura Hills , Calif .	19

appeal.v.37	appeal.v	appeal	v	In Missouri , those caught drinking and driving between the ages of 16 and 21 may have their licenses revoked for one year , while those 21 or older suffer only a 30-day suspension . A Boone County judge rejected the motion , but Daniel Dodson , a Jefferson City lawyer , says he has appealed . And in a case filed in federal court in August , a lawyer is arguing that Missouri authorities are wrongfully imprisoning the fetus of a pregnant woman who is in jail for theft and forgery .	55

Now a startling new approach is available to building your financial portfolio without undue risk , without extensive planning and without hurting your life style one bit !	25
appeal.v.40	appeal.v	appeal	v	Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed , the suit alleged . Such schemes , says Tony Adamski , chief of the financial-crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington , D.C. , appeal to investors ' `` desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity . '' At times , salesmen may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the person is being included in , '' says Mr. Cunningham .	36
appeal.v.41	appeal.v	appeal	v	At times , salesmen may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the person is being included in , '' says Mr. Cunningham . In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts , the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others . It also adds to the mystery of the venture .	36
appeal.v.42	appeal.v	appeal	v	There are all sorts of variations on term insurance : policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt , term riders tacked on to permanent insurance , and many others . One variation that appealed to me at first was the `` Money Smart Term Life '' policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co. , the American Express unit , to the parent company 's credit-card holders . Upon examination , however , I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense .	34
appeal.v.43	appeal.v	appeal	v	Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter 's team , and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean , mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s . Appealing to a young audience , he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead . The lyric chosen -- `` long strange night '' -- may be an apt footnote to television spots by both candidates intended to portray each other as a liar .	27
appeal.v.44	appeal.v	appeal	v	From Chevy trucks to Lipton iced tea to a host of battling banks , the state has been inundated with broadcast commercials and print advertising campaigns celebrating Texans and castigating outsiders . While advertisers have long appealed to Texans ' state pride and prejudices , the latest trend has been sparked , in part , by the state 's recent hard economic times . That has taken some of the swagger out of natives who like to brag that Texas is the only state that was once a nation , but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders .	36

appeal.v.48	appeal.v	appeal	v	The Democratic Leadership Council , a centrist group sponsoring the plan , surely thought it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents . A provision allowing grants to be applied to first-home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling . The DLC plan envisaged `` volunteers '' planting trees , emptying bedpans , tutoring children , and assisting librarians for $ 100 a week , tax free , plus medical care .	44

Tunisia has again appealed to international conscience to take action , to stop the blood and end the destructive war , and create conditions for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .

owe.v.7	owe.v	owe	v	This was particularly true in the world arena , which was an anarchical battleground characterized by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires . That any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have astonished a nineteenth-century statesman .

owe.v.8	owe.v	owe	v	Even the most rational of men , under great stress , may be transported by a new faith and behave like mystics . Helion knew that he owed his freedom as much to the self-sacrifice of his fellow-men in Arbeitskommando 13 , , Stettin , as to his own fierce will and love of life . After that , he declared , `` to return to freedom was to fall to one 's knees before the real world and adore it '' .	27
owe.v.9	owe.v	owe	v	Others who wrote of low characters and low life included Thomas Bangs Thorpe , creator of the Big Bear Of Arkansas and Tom Owen , the Bee-Hunter ; ; Johnson Jones Hooper , whose character Simon Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried out his will ; ; and George Washington Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature . It would be profitable , I believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner 's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to Faulkner 's time . Such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner is recording actuality in the South and moreover is following a long-established literary precedent .	123

Mr. Nahas , who single-handedly provoked a one-day closure of Brazil 's stock markets in June when he failed to honor a debt of $ 31.1 million owed to his brokers , yesterday blamed his predicament on the president of the Sao Paulo stock exchange ; a few days before Mr. Nahas 's failure , the exchange raised the required margin on stock-margin transactions .

Instead , he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of stairs and stood before the seated Fudo at their head .

A Libyan dissident exiled in Egypt Mohammed Fias Jabrel says he is satisfied with the verdict because it proves Libya has committed crimes against innocent people but Mr. Jabrel says he hopes the case is not closed . I hope that the investigations would continue to bring the real murderers which is of the League of Col. Gaddafi .	42

commit.v.5	commit.v	commit	v	The special session of the UN Human Rights Commission has condemned Israel for widespread systematic and gross violations of human rights in the occupied territories .

commit.v.9	commit.v	commit	v	His brutal efforts to create a Serb - dominated Yugoslavia earned him the nickname `` Butcher of the Balkans . '' Many speculated that Milosevic , whose parents and uncle committed suicide , might be mentally unbalanced himself . Constitutionally barred from serving a third term as Serbian President , he clung to power by having the federal parliament elect him President of Yugoslavia .	30

Sears was serving a 30 - year sentence for the self-confessed 1992 killing of his wife in Clinton , Maryland , but after a relentless campaign that included a letter from his psychiatrist saying Sears was unlikely to commit such violence again , the judge in this case , got him released .

Held as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of Mickey Jelke , the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed to the Women 's House of Detention , a terribly overcrowded prison . It is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk the District Attorney into having her removed from the prison to a hotel room , with her meals taken at Vesuvio 's , an excellent Italian restaurant .	49
commit.v.15	commit.v	commit	v	In such diseases as cancer , tuberculosis , and heart disease , early diagnosis and treatment are so vital that the waste of time by the patient with Doctor Fraud 's cure-all gadget can prove fatal . Moreover , the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can be committing suicide . For instance : In Chicago , some time ago , Mr. H. , age 27 , a diabetic since he was six , stopped using insulin because he had bought a `` magic spike '' -- a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent -- sold by the Vrilium Company of Chicago for $ 306 as a cure-all .	59

He was also at the same time gaining practical experience as a safe breaker and highwayman , and learning how to shoot to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene Geary , later committed to Chester Asylum as a homicidal maniac , but whose eyes misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor . O'Banion 's first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to Bridewell Prison for three months for burglary ; ; two years later he served another three months for assault .	68

The only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an open fire . This invariably effaces any wine 's character , and drives its fragrance underground .	64
commit.v.19	commit.v	commit	v	We were not , however , entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street . We were forbidden to swing on the gates , lest they sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way , but we could stand on them , when they were latched , rest our chins on the top , and stare and stare , committing to memory , quite unintentionally , all the details that lay before our eyes . The street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees , and silence was a weight , almost palpable , in the air .	60
commit.v.20	commit.v	commit	v	Hence the prime issue , as I see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature . We are already committed to establishing man 's supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited social-political-economical context we are fond of today . Otherwise , we go on endlessly trying to draw the line , color and other , as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate .	50

Although New Orleans was not to learn of it for a spell , she also was a sadist , a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad -- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American soil . Madame Lalaurie gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders .	51
commit.v.27	commit.v	commit	v	She felt as if some dark , totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at her arm ; ; but she found the path she always used , the stubs of branches she had broken , those she had pushed aside ; ; and she walked easily now , and more slowly , until she could see the dark glisten of water beneath her . If I ever committed suicide , she thought , I would dive straight down from here -- and no one would find me for days . She smiled , and expertly let herself downward , holding this known root or that , her sneakers sliding in the leaves .	66
commit.v.28	commit.v	commit	v	Although not much desiring the account , he had been appointed advertising head of Zenith . Freed of routine by having his own firm and a complaisant partner , his work in New York had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure ; ; and if he was n't entirely committed to what he did , he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities . Mr. Willis , eager to have him allied with the family , wanted advice beyond the confines of his field , and William set out on a serious study of the situation , including trips to Wisconsin and Washington .	55

commit.v.47	commit.v	commit	v	The American Bar Association 's House of Delegates passed a resolution in 1985 condemning the IRS reporting requirement . Michael Ross , a New York lawyer who heads the ABA 's grand jury committee , said that lawyers are prohibited by the ABA 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death .

Stanley Aslanian , the Haas broker who agreed to carry a hidden microphone during the conversation , also has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities violations in the stock manipulation and agreed to cooperate . According to the transcript , Mr. Lorin said Mr. Laff should be killed after Mr. Aslanian told him that information given to Mr. Laff by another conspirator could jeopardize the stock scheme .	49
commit.v.49	commit.v	commit	v	Neither technique is perfect , but both are better than the current system , which misstates the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average about $ 20 billion annually , according to the Congressional Budget Office .

Impose standard accounting and administrative practices .	70
commit.v.50	commit.v	commit	v	Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law against white-collar defendants , as opposed to alleged organized-crime figures , has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars . Critics have complained that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains . In the new guidelines , the Justice Department says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial , `` the government will not seek to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant '' and `` will not seek ... to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them . ''	49
commit.v.51	commit.v	commit	v	And Gorky , considered the father of Soviet socialist realism , did not write plays that easily lend themselves to deliberately antirealistic distancing techniques . Gorky was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed to enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of Chekhovian humanism . And `` Summerfolk , '' penned in 1904 as a kind of sequel to Chekhov 's `` Cherry Orchard , '' is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers .	34
commit.v.52	commit.v	commit	v	International investigators urged Britain to allow prosecution of suspected Nazi war criminals who took refuge there after 1945 . Under current law , such suspects are immune from prosecution for acts committed while not British citizens . `` If we 're not careful we could become known as a haven for war criminals , '' said Jeff Rooker , a member of Parliament and one of several British politicians attending a London conference with government investigators from the U.S. , Canada and Australia .	31
commit.v.53	commit.v	commit	v	But transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last . Although one transportation official said drivers who did n't use car pools were committing `` an anti-social act , '' about two-thirds of the motorists crossing the Golden Gate were alone , compared with the normal 70 % rate . And some commuters , relieved by the absence of gridlock , were planning to return to their old ways .	27
commit.v.54	commit.v	commit	v	But it is unfair to dump on teachers , as distinct from the educational establishment .

They may not be among the `` best and brightest '' of their generation -- there are very few such people , by definition .	29
commit.v.55	commit.v	commit	v	The changes apply to prosecutions brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law . Under that law , defendants who allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of a `` criminal enterprise '' may be charged with racketeering and forced to forfeit the proceeds of the enterprise . The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers .	22
commit.v.56	commit.v	commit	v	Expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns , shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale . I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers . My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold , according to my conservative calculations .	30
commit.v.57	commit.v	commit	v	The deportation of more than 315,000 men , women and children by the Bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years . Yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry : that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed by the Turks in the 16th century . Today 's Turks in Bulgaria , in other words , deserve what is coming to them four centuries later .	52
commit.v.58	commit.v	commit	v	In addition , the regime has established well-paid paramilitary forces totaling more than 100,000 , including 35,000 Soviet-trained troops of the Interior Ministry -LRB- KHAD\/WAD -RRB- , which still is directed by 1,500 Soviet KGB officers . Even if not all these forces are committed to the regime , they are now dependent on it . And thousands of Afghan children have been taken to the Soviet Union , where they are hostage for the behavior of their families .	44
commit.v.59	commit.v	commit	v	Still , Berbera was the best we could get , so we stay in bed with President Barrah . All these reports about him committing genocide are probably exaggerated anyway . But would n't you know , now that we are spending jillions of dollars , and have built those new divisions and new air wings , and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the Russians in Iran , the Russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject .	24
commit.v.60	commit.v	commit	v	Addison is no stranger to cans of worms , either . After its previous mayor committed suicide last year , an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects , gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town 's coffers for trips and retreats . The revelations embarrassed town officials , although they argued that the problems were n't as severe as the media suggested .	15
commit.v.61	commit.v	commit	v	A NATO project to build a frigate for the 1990s was torpedoed by the pull-out of three of its eight participating nations . Britain , France and Italy announced technical reasons for withdrawing , but some officials pointed to growing reluctance among the allies to commit themselves to big defense spending while East-West disarmament talks show signs of success . Small wonder that Britain 's Labor Party wants credit controls .	45
commit.v.62	commit.v	commit	v	But playing word games over how to define the relationship is simply a way of hiding from the problem , ostrich-like , as the situation deteriorates .

pour.v.4	pour.v	pour	v	The giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones . They usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height , but when they pour into a V-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions .

My lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy for cuts and wounds ; ; she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth , over which she poured turpentine . He showed me one of his fingers which had been practically amputated and which his mother had treated ; ; there is scarcely a scar showing .	74
pour.v.7	pour.v	pour	v	Until quite recently , `` sterile '' maggots could be bought to apply to a wound ; ; they would feed on its surface , leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated . Tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound . One family bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips , or , if these were not handy , plain lard .	41
pour.v.8	pour.v	pour	v	Though by no means an ideal procedure , a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time . It may be a bit cold when poured ; ; but again , as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt , wine should be served in a large , tulip-shaped glass , which is never filled more than half full . In this way , red wine warms of itself quite rapidly -- and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal -LRB- or the course -RRB- , in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages .	39
pour.v.9	pour.v	pour	v	Frequently we are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted and in the end only the good ones will survive .

pour.v.10	pour.v	pour	v	Geneva , instead of becoming the City of God , as John had dreamed , had in the two years since he had been there , continued to be a godless place where all manner of vice flourished .

pour.v.13	pour.v	pour	v	As the camp emptied , it was refilled by a draining of the camps and towns around Lublin , then by deportees from outside Poland .

She had swished away , she had been gone for a long time probably when Sarah suddenly realized that she ought to stop her , pour out the coffee , so no one would drink it . But then the so-called coffee was bad enough at best , cold it was all but undrinkable -- especially that cup ! !	58
pour.v.20	pour.v	pour	v	He stood up , stretched , looked around for the bubbles , but could see none . Strolling down to the galley , he lit the butane under the coffee pot and when the brew was heated , poured himself a cup and went up to the chartroom . Turning on the hi-fi , he went back to the cockpit , stretched out on the cushions and listened to the music .	38

Once inside his apartment , he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped limply in a chair . After a while he began to feel better about it , especially when no one bothered to ask any questions .	24
pour.v.22	pour.v	pour	v	Fuming , helpless , he watched them pass him . The sail , ragged though it was , still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power being poured out from the nursery stars . He would never have believed , without seeing it , that the bizarre little vessel could go so fast .	31

Slowly and thoughtfully , she slipped the ornament into the pocket of her slacks , moved down the stairs and out of the house .	34
pour.v.27	pour.v	pour	v	Along with this self-satisfaction , however , Joyce sensed a growing tension . It poured out of him like an electric current , a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action , and that that action would be all that he anticipated . Joyce had seen him like this once before -- more than once , actually , but on one particularly memorable occasion .	14
pour.v.28	pour.v	pour	v	I spun about and clattered through the front room to the door . As I went out , I could hear water pouring in the shower . Hot water .	22

pour.v.31	pour.v	pour	v	He held his long clenched foot in both hands , and this and his contorted face -- he was trying heroically not to cry out -- made him look like a large skinny old monkey . They all surrounded him , the family circle , Theresa and George as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens , and Cousin Emma running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming into a white enamelled pan . `` Can you think of anything to do '' ? ? She kept repeating .	75

What Aeroflot does n't pour into its own gas-guzzling Ilyushins is bartered to the airport authority , which resells it to 11 Western carriers including Air France , Trans World Airlines and Pakistan International Airlines . Aeroflot thus pays its landing fees , ground-handling and catering bills with fuel , preserving its hard currency .	28
pour.v.39	pour.v	pour	v	Now , GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s . One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match . Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year .	37

Fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies .	44
pour.v.41	pour.v	pour	v	`` The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said one government official , insisting on anonymity . The Fed 's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled Sunday morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories quoting a senior Fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning .

deny.v.25	deny.v	deny	v	And when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious mind is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind . Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence . The question becomes , `` What is a dream '' ? ?	45
deny.v.26	deny.v	deny	v	When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep . If the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life . Dr. H.V. Hilprecht , Professor of Assyrian at the University of Pennsylvania , dreamed that a Babylonian priest , associated with the king Kurigalzu , -LRB- 1300 B.C. -RRB- escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification .	56
deny.v.27	deny.v	deny	v	We may conclude that all six points of information , ostensibly given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by Dr. Hilprecht 's subconscious reasoning . But , in denying any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden substitution ? ? Which theory is more fantastic : 1 . That the perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions in the professor 's brain , or 2 . That the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal , gradient frequencies , across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient Nippur met ? ?	31

deny.v.29	deny.v	deny	v	These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case . It might be contended , of course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism . But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment .	25
deny.v.30	deny.v	deny	v	To both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul , lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications . Dominated by the vicious circle of the university promotion system , the analyst looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups , although he can not deny his debt to the collector . The knowledge that most Americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors .	53
deny.v.31	deny.v	deny	v	This is particularly acute for those who attended Midwood High School directly across the street from Brooklyn College . They have a sense of marginality at being denied that special badge of status , the out-of-town school . At the same time , there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good college -- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues -- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that the college generates .	27
deny.v.32	deny.v	deny	v	All in all , though , there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking ; ; many people go to extreme lengths in decanting , chilling or warming , or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork . No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism ! ! But the fact remains that in most restaurants , including some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon , the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered , and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is preparing the meal .	59
deny.v.33	deny.v	deny	v	An essay on `` Freedom '' written at 10 years of age quoted the Declaration of Independence , the freedom given to slaves in Canada , and the views of George Washington . Lucy Upton was graduated from the Salem High School when few colleges , only Oberlin and Elmira , were open to women ; ; and she had an appetite for learning that could not be denied . A picture of her in high school comes from a younger schoolmate , Albert S. Flint , friend of her brother Winslow , and later , like Winslow , a noted astronomer .	68
deny.v.34	deny.v	deny	v	The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries . There is much truth in both these charges , and not many Bourbons deny them . Whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites .	32
deny.v.35	deny.v	deny	v	But that is a cliche and a dishonest one . The smell is sexual , but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it . Their skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost the consistency of a second skin .	24
deny.v.36	deny.v	deny	v	Such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum renaissance . It is interesting , however , that despite this strong upsurge in Southern writing , almost none of the writers has forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the season 's cotton and tobacco crops ; ; of the stereotyped Negro servants chanting hymns as they plow the fields ; ; of these and a host of other antiquated legends that deny the South its progressive leaps of the past century . This is not to say that the South is no longer agrarian ; ; such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification .	100
deny.v.37	deny.v	deny	v	Modern writers , who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects , insist upon drawing out this legend , prolonging its burial , when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century . Perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing ; ; but they can hardly deny that , exaggerated or not , the old panorama is dead . As John T. Westbrook says in his article , `` Twilight Of Southern Regionalism '' -LRB- Southwest Review , Winter 1957 -RRB- : `` The miasmal mausoleum where an Old South , already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry , should be left to rest in peace , forever dead and -LRB- let us fervently hope -RRB- forever done with '' .	60
deny.v.38	deny.v	deny	v	Consitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world courts , and the veto power in world councils are but a few examples . Most of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it . The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme .	67
deny.v.39	deny.v	deny	v	Who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community ? ? That regional peculiarities do not still exist ? ? That the Court order does not unequally affect the Southern region ? ? Who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal action is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept of `` the consent of the governed '' ? ? Circumstances alter cases .	38
deny.v.40	deny.v	deny	v	I 'm talking about the grand manner of the Liberal -- North and South -- who is not affected personally . If these people were denied a voice -LRB- do they have a moral right to a voice ? ? -RRB- , what voices would be left ? ? Who is involved willy nilly ? ?	25
deny.v.41	deny.v	deny	v	They reincarnated the figures of human beings banished from his canvases since the 1920 's . These new pictures focussed on the familiar and commonplace objects that he had heard the men in his prison camp talking about as the things they missed most , hence associated with the sense of lost freedom : the cafe at the corner , the newspaper kiosk , the girls in doorways and windows along the street , the golden-crusted French bread they lacked , the cigarettes denied them . One of the pictures was of a man with hat drawn over his face ceremoniously lighting a cigarette ; ; others were of men doffing their hats to each other , carrying umbrellas with pomp , reading newspapers , or simply showing loaves of bread spread out .	83
deny.v.42	deny.v	deny	v	Important as was Mr. O'Donnell's essay , his thesis is so restricting as to deny Faulkner the stature which he obviously has . He and also Mr. Cowley and Mr. Warren have fallen to the temptation which besets many of us to read into our authors -- Nathaniel Hawthorne , for example , and Herman Melville -- protests against modernism , material progress , and science which are genuine protests of our own but may not have been theirs .	14
deny.v.43	deny.v	deny	v	He is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary traditions than he was within the traditions -- or possibly the regulations -- governing his tenure in the post office at Oxford , Mississippi , thirty-five years ago . That is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of course , that he is steeped in them , in fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books . It is to say rather , I believe , that he has brought to bear on the history , the traditions , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind -- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique .	53
deny.v.44	deny.v	deny	v	It is engendered by confounding the Aristotelian cosmology in The Almagest with the geocentric astronomy . Ptolemy recurrently denies that he could ever explain planetary motion . This is what necessitates the nonsystematic character of his astronomy .	18
deny.v.45	deny.v	deny	v	There was one fact which Rector could not overlook , one truth which he could not deny . As long as there were two human beings working together on the same project , there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave .	16
deny.v.46	deny.v	deny	v	He had hoped to be alone in the bombproof , but the soldier had followed him . Though Watson carefully ignored the man , he could not deny his presence . Perhaps it would be better to speak to him , since silence could not exorcise his form .	27
deny.v.47	deny.v	deny	v	Everything in the office , the spreading circle of lamplight , the patch of leather in Lolotte 's hands . George poised with the tack hammer , the homely , everyday atmosphere , all denied an attempt at murder . A rush of panic caught Sarah .	34
deny.v.48	deny.v	deny	v	He was also , if Pam North was right , a closer acquaintance of Lauren Payne 's than she , now , was inclined to admit . He might deny the latter ; ; would certainly deny any connection between the two things , or any connection of either with murder . He would have to be given the opportunity .	29

Standing there she saw Shades of Night come through the trees and stop beside the lodge , silent , almost imperious , her body taut , simply standing without speaking or moving while the wife of Walitzee waited , perhaps denying the dread that moved in her .

We have heard that after seeing Mr. Quasimodo 's work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement .

deny.v.74	deny.v	deny	v	This phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through Congress . It signals Congress 's attempt , under the pretext of guarding the public purse , to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in Article II of the Constitution . This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional .	32
deny.v.75	deny.v	deny	v	Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing . The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary . The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government .	41

Yet , in spite of this , intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what 's wrong with him ; ; to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen . Naturally , the patient does not say , `` I hate my father '' , or `` Sibling rivalry is what bugs me '' .	87
lay.v.22	lay.v	lay	v	Because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value , care for its origin , and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients , the food does taste good . When served in a psychological atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension , a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments , the athletic programs and the most important phase , the educational opportunities . Situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain scenery in the country , the school buildings are located amid open fields and farm lands .	63
lay.v.23	lay.v	lay	v	Over in Barre the streets had been deep in swirling water , and bridges were crumpled and gone . Anticipating delivery of medicines and yeast by plane , Granite City citizens formed an airfield committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd Infantry , Vermont National Guard , laid out runways on Wilson flat , high on Millstone Hill . The `` Barre Aviation Field '' was set to receive its first aircraft the Sunday following the flood .	50
lay.v.24	lay.v	lay	v	In 1930 , the Lambeth Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate . In 1958 , the Conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by God on parents everywhere . Many other Protestant denominations preceded the Anglicans in such action .	46
lay.v.25	lay.v	lay	v	A `` chaw '' of tobacco put on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing . Or a thin slice of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing . One old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his head .	26

One old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his head . His brother ran a mile to get the father ; ; when they reached the boy , the father sliced a new plug of tobacco , put the scalp back in place , and covered the raw edges with the slices .	42
lay.v.27	lay.v	lay	v	The raising of the $ 25,000 Improvement Fund two days before the time limit expired , and the spontaneous `` praise demonstration '' held afterward on the campus , were reported as events which had brought happiness to Miss Giles . With the Fund in hand , the debt on the boilers had been paid ; ; Rockefeller and Packard Halls had been renovated ; ; walks laid ; ; and ground had been broken for the superintendent 's home . Miss Upton spoke gratefully of the response of Spelman graduates and Negro friends in helping to raise the Fund , and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly needed current expenses .	67
lay.v.28	lay.v	lay	v	It is a splendid structure . From upstream it looks like a long arcaded box laid across the river ; ; from downstream , where the water level is much lower , it is a high , elaborately facaded pavilion . The top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile .	15
lay.v.29	lay.v	lay	v	These my grandmother left in their places -LRB- they are still there , more persistent and longer-lived than the generations of man -RRB- and planted others like them , that flourished without careful tending . Three of these only were protected from us by stern commandment : the roses , whose petals might not be collected until they had fallen , to be made into perfume or rose-tea to drink ; ; the peonies , whose tight sticky buds would be blighted by the laying on of a finger , although they were not apparently harmed by the ants that crawled over them ; ; and the poppies . I have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap , unfolded , and shook out like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals .	84
lay.v.30	lay.v	lay	v	But the fences were still in place fifty-odd years ago , and when we stood on the gate to look over , the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving stones with grass between and on both sides . The curb was a line of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost in the ground or the roots of trees . Opposite every gate was a hitching post or a stone carriage-step , set with a rusty iron ring for tying a horse .	51
lay.v.31	lay.v	lay	v	Slowly the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral , the shrine of so many precious memories . The guns are fired , the hymns are sung , and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors . As he had longed to be , he became the echo of a saga .	52
lay.v.32	lay.v	lay	v	Standing in the shelter of the tent -- a rejected hospital tent on which the rain now dripped , no longer drumming -- Adam watched his own hands touch the objects on the improvised counter of boards laid across two beer barrels . There was , of course , no real need to rearrange everything .	37
lay.v.33	lay.v	lay	v	The rain dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street . Beyond that misty gray of the rain , he saw the stretching hutment , low diminutive log cabins , chinked with mud , with doorways a man would have to crouch to get through , with roofs of tenting laid over boughs or boards from hardtack boxes , or fence rails , with cranky chimneys of sticks and dried mud . The chimney of the hut across from him was surmounted by a beef barrel with ends knocked out .	50
lay.v.34	lay.v	lay	v	When might Mary have had that moment to hold her child on her lap ? ? Perhaps after the soldiers had laid him on the ground , while Joseph of Arimathea was at Pontius Pilate 's asking for Christ 's body , Nicodemus was gathering his mixture of myrrh and aloes , and the others had gone home to mourn . Those who saw his finished Pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses .	21
lay.v.35	lay.v	lay	v	New York lay bleaching in the summer sun , and the morning fish hawk , flying in the heated air , saw below him the long triangular wedge of Manhattan Island . It was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into pig-infested streets , mostly around the Battery , going bravely north to Wall Street , but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of Harlem Heights . From there it looked across at Westchester County and the Hudson River where the manor houses , estates , and big farms of the original -LRB- non-Indian -RRB- landowners began .	41
lay.v.36	lay.v	lay	v	I heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs . Hans had laid steaming towels over the kid 's chest and stomach . He was rubbing snow on the kid 's legs and feet .	11

lay.v.38	lay.v	lay	v	`` All right , you bastards '' , I said , `` the great actor is about to buy a drink '' . I laid a tenspot on the bar and motioned to the bartender to serve a round . He had just returned my change when the doorman came in off the street to page me .	24
lay.v.39	lay.v	lay	v	I 'll be waiting for you there '' . The bartender brought Rourke 's drink and Shayne laid a twenty-dollar bill on the bar . He said in a low voice , `` I 've got a date with a lady , Mister .	17
lay.v.40	lay.v	lay	v	Because , if for no other reason , Willings would never for a moment suppose he was not bigger , tougher , than anything else that went on two legs . Ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves , as any man may against a tiger . Faith Constable had had to `` go on '' from the party and had , presumably , gone on .	33
lay.v.41	lay.v	lay	v	He stared at the report in Killpath 's hand , sure it was written by Accacia -- just as sure as if he 'd submitted it in his scrawled longhand . He sucked in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet again , wound the gold-wire stems of his glasses around his ears and then , eying the report as it lay before him on the desk , intoned , `` Acting Lieutenant Gunnar Matson one failed to see that the station keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the station 's activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the Homicide Detail of the Inspector 's Bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander Acting Captain O.T.

lay.v.42	lay.v	lay	v	That 's why I beg you not to forget him . His ghost is not laid . Red and Handley , God help them , knew the old Dogtown lore ; ; and I knew they knew it , for I 'd told them a lot of it .	15

lay.v.45	lay.v	lay	v	Powers knocked his arm aside . Deliberately , with none of Rankin 's viciousness , he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the guard 's head . They were free .	16
lay.v.46	lay.v	lay	v	That was the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of Big Sands with Aaron McBride , field boss for the Highlands Oil & Gas Company . Tom had been laying for Aaron McBride for a long time , just waiting to catch him out of line . McBride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip .	33
lay.v.47	lay.v	lay	v	`` huh-uh . Now , Mis-ter McBride '' , said Lord , and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss 's arm . It was strictly the deputy 's game , but McBride had gone too far to throw in .	14
lay.v.48	lay.v	lay	v	They moved in on him , crowded him from all sides . No man laid a hand on him , but the threat of violence was there . His face took on a sudden pallor , became beaded with sweat , and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing .	14
lay.v.49	lay.v	lay	v	Once again , he shook his head , kept his face expressionless and his voice very calm , and had a strongly supported alibi ready . Later , riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies of Cheyenne , he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations he made . `` Exterminatin ' cow thieves is just a business proposition with me '' , he 'd blandly announce .	44
lay.v.50	lay.v	lay	v	Ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth . It was a straight , solid , once-in-a-lifetime shot ; ; he laid all four knuckles in between the man 's cheekbone and his chin . Ramey 's fist and the air expelled from the man 's collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands clapping together .	26
lay.v.51	lay.v	lay	v	`` Are you a thrower of flame , marine '' ? ? Matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground , out of the marine 's reach and away from their shadows . He waited in his squat , gripping the hair .	21

lay.v.53	lay.v	lay	v	Maggie could n't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do : there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back ; ; there was the daily round of household chores in which Maggie insisted on participating . Worry had a great deal to do with it ; ; Stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father 's office , taking what salary his father could hand out to him . Mr. Clifton would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his wife 's people without contributing to his and his family 's upkeep , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap .	73
lay.v.54	lay.v	lay	v	The search began , in all the rooms , running upstairs , down , opening closets , talking , exclaiming in rushes and gasps . Everything was as I had left it the night before last -- her portfolio and bag for town , her lingerie and dress and shoes laid out only her mink coat was missing . And she .	50
lay.v.55	lay.v	lay	v	`` I do n't mind at all '' , he said , delighted with her attention . Changing his clothes , he put on his dark-blue flannel suit , and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for good . But it was a hopeful sign , he told himself .	30
lay.v.56	lay.v	lay	v	The pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life . Lying awake at night , he could see them , laid out on the floor of his mind . When he rose in the morning , the image was still there .	20
lay.v.57	lay.v	lay	v	Instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her panties , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same . He felt that it would be a particular humiliation to Dolores to pick up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor . Furthermore , he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly : every time he went in the bedroom , he could drop a slip or a brassiere , or maybe a girdle , next to his shorts .	64
lay.v.58	lay.v	lay	v	To his amazement he reached him . Mr. Crumb was laid up with a bad cold . He did n't seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the worktable equally lightly .	10
lay.v.59	lay.v	lay	v	A couple of years back , I occupied a Village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of niche called a `` coffin turn '' . In it was a stone Tibetan Buddha I had picked up in Bombay , and occasionally , to make merit , my wife and I garlanded it with flowers or laid a few pennies in its lap . After a while , we became aware that the money was disappearing as fast as we replenished it .	56

lay.v.71	lay.v	lay	v	The argument turns on the discovery in 1909 of an amazing fossil quarry high in the Canadian Rockies called the Burgess Shale . Here , in an area smaller than a city block , lay buried traces of countless weird creatures that had frolicked more than 500 million years ago -- creatures whose anatomical variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world 's oceans today . Such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the man who discovered the Burgess Shale , one Charles Doolittle Walcott .	34
lay.v.72	lay.v	lay	v	California legislators , searching for ways to pay for the $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion in damages from last week 's earthquake , are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the state 's sales tax . The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from Congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in California 's earthquake relief efforts .	26

lay.v.77	lay.v	lay	v	The discounting , say fast-food operators , occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before . The result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even , laying off middle managers and working harder to make less . Joe Mack , a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc. , a Burger King operator in Omaha , Neb. , says discounting is so prevalent that `` we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers '' to keep sales level .	35

I think what bothered me most about the piece was that there seemed to be an underlying attitude to tell your readers all is well -- if you 're getting laid off do n't worry , and if you 're unemployed , it 's a seller 's market .

apply.v.14	apply.v	apply	v	That is when American Airlines Flight 903 ran into trouble on a trip from Boston to Miami . The pilots of that plane forcibly applied their rudder to recover from a stall , and as a result the plane 's tail section exceeded its design limits . Pilots managed to land safely , only after a terrifying ordeal for passengers .	24
apply.v.15	apply.v	apply	v	All these materials and supplementary manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year . It was applied with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader . Years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity .	27
apply.v.16	apply.v	apply	v	He knew just the thing for her -- a treatment from his `` cosmic light ozone generator '' machine . As he applied the applicator extending from the machine -- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base -- to the supposedly diseased portions of Mrs. Shaefer 's body , Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo . Yes , the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything , he assured her .	22
apply.v.17	apply.v	apply	v	Orthodontic work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not rigidly , by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network , to the bone in the jaw ; ; they are not anchored directly to the bone . Abnormal pressure , applied over a period of time , produces a change in the bony deposit , so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided . What can 10-year-old Susan expect when she enters the orthodontist 's office ? ?	45

Here again laboratory approaches are being evolved , for it is recognized how `` elastic '' these readings can be , how they can apply to many people , and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individual 's own case . If you look at a reading meant for someone else , you will probably see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you , even when you were not in the picture at all ! !	39

apply.v.20	apply.v	apply	v	If you look at a reading meant for someone else , you will probably see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you , even when you were not in the picture at all ! ! An interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a `` hit '' , describing something accurately for him , but can he really be sure that another sitter , hearing the same statement , would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances ? ? It is , of course , easy to see how `` J '' will mean Uncle Jack to one person and little Jane to another .	77
apply.v.21	apply.v	apply	v	It is , of course , easy to see how `` J '' will mean Uncle Jack to one person and little Jane to another . `` A journey '' , `` a little white house '' , `` a change of outlook '' , can apply to many people . And even more complex items can be interpreted to conform to one 's own point of view , which is by nature so personal .	46
apply.v.22	apply.v	apply	v	If he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him , he can more readily assess each item in a larger frame : `` Does that statement really sound as if it were for me , significant in my particular life ? ? Or am I taking something that could really apply to almost anybody , and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar experience '' ? ? Conversely , experimenters would consider as impressive such statements as the following , which , if they turned out to be hits , are so unusual as to be really significant : `` He had four children , two sets of twins .	56
apply.v.23	apply.v	apply	v	That is one thing the experiments are designed to find out . So , after the sitting has been held , several readings at one time are mailed , and the distant sitter -LRB- whose name or whose communicator 's name was given to the medium -RRB- must mark each little item as Correct -LRB- Hit -RRB- , Incorrect -LRB- Miss -RRB- , Doubtful , or Especially Significant -LRB- applying to him and , he feels , not to anyone else -RRB- . He is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his .	69

One can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the United States in more recent years . The popularity of local color literature before the Spanish-American War , the steady currency of the Lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier West in our mass media are cases in point .	39

apply.v.28	apply.v	apply	v	The results were good , but which treatment helped is still not known . To stop bleeding , cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds . One old-timer said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut , even when on a knuckle , if it was made by a rusty tool ; ; this would stop the flow and also prevent infection .	20
apply.v.29	apply.v	apply	v	Veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding , and rue was an antiseptic . Until quite recently , `` sterile '' maggots could be bought to apply to a wound ; ; they would feed on its surface , leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated . Tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound .	30
apply.v.30	apply.v	apply	v	Since a fall or blow might have caused it , a cold pack was usually first aid . This might be applied to the top of the nose or the back of the neck , pressed on the upper lip , or inserted into the nostril -LRB- cotton was usually used in this last -RRB- . Nosebleed could be stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient 's neck and tying it in a knot for each year of his life .	21
apply.v.31	apply.v	apply	v	Felons were cured by taking common salt and drying it in the oven , pounding it fine , and mixing it with equal parts of spirits of turpentine ; ; this mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around the affected part . As the cloth dried , more of the mixture was applied , and after twenty-four hours the felon was supposed to be `` killed '' . Insect bites were cured in many ways .	55
apply.v.32	apply.v	apply	v	Bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief and also killed the pests . Ant bites were eased by applying liquid bluing . For mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half a glass of soda was made .	19
apply.v.33	apply.v	apply	v	Bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days ; ; to keep them out of homes , even in the 1900 's , was a chore . Bed slats were washed in alum water , legs of beds were placed in cups of kerosene , and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate , applied with a feather . Kerosene was very effective in ridding pioneer homes of the pests .	55
apply.v.34	apply.v	apply	v	Shingles were cured by gentian , an old drug , used in combinations . For erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and one ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth . Itching skin , considered `` just nerves '' , was eased by treating with whiskey and salt .	27
apply.v.35	apply.v	apply	v	Itching skin , considered `` just nerves '' , was eased by treating with whiskey and salt . Winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped . To cure fungus growths on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of sassafras bark in a quart of water .	23
apply.v.36	apply.v	apply	v	One veracious woman tells me she has used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they remove the pain or `` fire '' . Another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten minutes in warm water , then to apply a solution of equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight . This softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on .	47
apply.v.37	apply.v	apply	v	High-level abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision . That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies , in which `` popular '' sovereignty is said to exist , and in federal nations , in which the jobs of government are split . Nevertheless , nationalism and sovereignty are reputed , in the accepted wisdom , to describe the modern world .	20
apply.v.38	apply.v	apply	v	Multiple circuits , routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible . The same principle of `` redundancy '' applies to all communications on these special networks . And no messages can be transmitted on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in advance , by special codes , that the messages actually come from their purported sources .	21
apply.v.39	apply.v	apply	v	But , since they have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity , how are they to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal ? ? Some look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work . Others , less consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times , experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet , painter , and musician .	40
apply.v.40	apply.v	apply	v	The composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of intervals -LRB- or rhythms or dynamic changes -RRB- . He may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers . But he can not order his elements by will , either rational or inspired .	29
apply.v.41	apply.v	apply	v	But , for practical purposes , we have people who can be considered as such . For example , there are persons who are in physical science , in the field of mineralogy , trained in crystallography , who use only X-rays , applying only the powder technique of X-ray diffraction , to clay minerals only , and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating on the montmorillonites ; ; or persons in the social sciences in the field of anthropology , studying the lung capacity of seven Andean Indians . So we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more about less and less as he develops , as contrasted to the generalist , who knows less and less about more and more .	43
apply.v.42	apply.v	apply	v	Strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship . Certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so .

apply.v.43	apply.v	apply	v	No Jew was on hand to boycott his financially struggling theater . It would have been unwise policy , for instance , to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty Scotchman .

apply.v.44	apply.v	apply	v	Hammarskjold 's supposed desire to seek outside legal advice in the guise of Ernest Gross is illusion , at best . Gross 's , being `` outside '' the U.N. applied only to a physical state , not an objective one . But by the time the papers were finally disposed of , the group had informed the world of its purpose , its recommendations , and its belief that Paul Bang-Jensen was not of sound mind .	30

apply.v.47	apply.v	apply	v	Many years later , the photon-counting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration .

apply.v.50	apply.v	apply	v	He had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there ; ; indeed , my scholastic qualifications were such that he , a college graduate himself , must envy me them . Was I sure , he asked , that I knew what I was applying for ? ? What sort of men I would come into contact with , at the hall ? ?	50
apply.v.51	apply.v	apply	v	These questions did not surprise me ; ; I felt certain that the director , like the afternoon clerk , seldom moved beyond the counter , that the hall , to them , was a jungle , a dark and unwelcome place . Though I doubted that he would understand me , I told the director my motives for applying . I had always , I said , hankered after working hard with my hands .	59

apply.v.55	apply.v	apply	v	There was a fifty-fifty chance , perhaps , that he would be unmarried , and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different . Japan did something to a man -- and it was n't just Japan , either , because the same thing applied anywhere overseas .

wait.v.19	wait.v	wait	v	Maybe he gives us information about the missing people , and perhaps Saddam Hussein . Further down the road , these men wait for a ride . Neither have anything bad to say about Aziz .	22
wait.v.20	wait.v	wait	v	From its flight deck President Bush will make a major announcement to the American people tomorrow night on the end of major combat in Iraq . Right now we 're also waiting to hear from the President at the White House . We 'll bring you his comments as soon as we get them and we 'll get to all of that shortly , but first , a move by the President today designed to save children 's lives and among his guests in the Rose Garden , Elizabeth Smart .	31
wait.v.21	wait.v	wait	v	Chad Myers joining me on the set . Typical perfect day in San Diego waiting for these men and women to come home .	14
wait.v.22	wait.v	wait	v	We 're going to say good-bye to Betsy . Some of these ladies and gentlemen are going to be saying hello to their families , standing on the side of the ship , ca n't wait to get off there . We 'll have that for you live .	35
wait.v.23	wait.v	wait	v	There were small pockets of resistance in the area , two , three man groups who had AKs and possibly RPGs and what not and our job was to just observe forward and make sure no one was waiting to ambush the AVs or the tanks and I was on a metal roof and I stepped --	38
wait.v.24	wait.v	wait	v	He sent O'Conner 's information to the state authorities for a background check . Once she was cleared , he made O'Conner wait for a minimum . Two weeks .	22
wait.v.25	wait.v	wait	v	A Texas woman is in jail this morning accused of killing her two sons and severely beating another the day before Mother 's Day . Yesterday a silent Dee Ana Laney waited as the judge read the charges against her , capital murder and aggravated assault . One of the first people to arrive at the crime scene , Judge James Marin .	31
wait.v.26	wait.v	wait	v	Reporter : The ship was sinking by the second , and as the waves pounded against them , waiting for help was their only option . Their life raft had already been snitched away by the high seas .	18
wait.v.27	wait.v	wait	v	To me looks like my child is my child , so I ca n't wait to have her .	14
wait.v.28	wait.v	wait	v	Reporter : After waiting nearly a year , things get a little complicated for the Kramers . SARS wreaks havoc in China and foreign adoptions are put on hold .	3
wait.v.29	wait.v	wait	v	Reporter : The Kramers must wait and travel to another town for Abby . On the next flight , passengers wear masks and their temperatures are taken for signs of SARS .	5
wait.v.30	wait.v	wait	v	Stocks modestly higher . Of course everyone is more or less waiting for the Fed decision on interest rates . We 're going to get that tomorrow .	11
wait.v.31	wait.v	wait	v	Well , we will wait for the report . Thank you , Susan .	4
wait.v.32	wait.v	wait	v	I want to read his letter . The chilling account raises new questions and criticism of the Russian Navy , which waited several days before attempting to launch a rescue mission , but U.S. Navy officials here at the Pentagon believe any rescue mission would have failed , that there was really no hope for those 23 survivors . With no power , more than 300 feet down , it 's believed any survivors would have frozen to death within hours , well before they ran out of air .	21
wait.v.33	wait.v	wait	v	9:00 this morning at New York 's La Guardia Airport , the weather is perfect , but already there are delays , a long line waiting to take off . La Guardia 's runways can handle a maximum of 75 takeoffs and landings an hour , but between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. each day , airlines schedule 93 , a mathematical impossibility , and it stays that way nearly all day long .	25
wait.v.34	wait.v	wait	v	He warned President Clinton to give up on finishing this year 's federal budget and freeze spending at current levels or face another potential government shutdown . DeLay also said he 's been waiting for 22 years for a Republican House and a White House and he promised the GOP agenda would get through , including a ban on late-term abortions .	33
wait.v.35	wait.v	wait	v	For grieving families , only a partial victory . After 12 years of waiting and a nine - month trial , family members of some of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103 come to this special Scottish courthouse in the Netherlands one last time to hear the verdict against two Libyan defendants charged with murder . A split decision for Lamen Khalifa Fhimah , aquittal , but Abdel Basset Ali Al-megrahi found guilty as charged .	13
wait.v.36	wait.v	wait	v	After it had reappeared the next two nights , Jenks went to higher headquarters and said : `` For three days now a German reconnaissance plane has been over the city taking pictures . They 're just waiting for the proper time to come over here and dump this place into the Adriatic '' . But the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist .	37
wait.v.37	wait.v	wait	v	Like hell ! ! Like hell he 'd wait -- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out ? ? What would his guns guide on then -- the North Star ? ?	8
wait.v.38	wait.v	wait	v	It seemed as though she were always auditioning . No believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors , the plump Pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to Cairo where she waited for nine months , vainly hoping to see Farouk . Pulley had set her up at the Semiramis Hotel , but she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the royal pimp had no key .	33
wait.v.39	wait.v	wait	v	No believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors , the plump Pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to Cairo where she waited for nine months , vainly hoping to see Farouk . Pulley had set her up at the Semiramis Hotel , but she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the royal pimp had no key . She picked her own Middle-Eastern friends from the flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her .	49
wait.v.40	wait.v	wait	v	Now a dentist can recommend extraction immediately . In other cases , in view of present-day knowledge of head growth , orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five years before treatment . The child is kept on call , and the orthodontist watches the growth .	24
wait.v.41	wait.v	wait	v	It will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment . He may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations , such as spraying or threshing , and for these , he may have to wait his turn . There will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his off-farm job .	40
wait.v.42	wait.v	wait	v	Hudson 's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the Thames . There at the river 's edge waited one Henry Greene , whom Hudson listed as a `` clerk '' . Greene was in actuality a young ruffian from Kent , who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred -- pimps , panders and whores .	23
wait.v.43	wait.v	wait	v	Greene was in actuality a young ruffian from Kent , who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred -- pimps , panders and whores . He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board and he had Greene wait at Gravesend , where the Discovery picked him up . For the first three weeks , the ship skirted up the east coast of Great Britain , then turned westward .	50
wait.v.44	wait.v	wait	v	It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine . After all , the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen 's comprehension and control . Anyone 's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement .	49
wait.v.45	wait.v	wait	v	Only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power : in Guatemala . And contrary to what has been said recently , we did not wait for `` outside pressures '' and `` world opinion '' to bring down that Communist government ; ; we moved decisively to effect an Anti-Communist coup d'etat . We served our national interests , and by so doing we saved the Guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery .	31
wait.v.46	wait.v	wait	v	Giffen had already urged him to journey south , if only for a few days to clear up matters . His duties as Massachusetts Secretary of State obliged him to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-April . Palfrey told his wife of his intentions for the first time , and left for New Orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of Providence that he might be allowed to see his family again .	30
wait.v.47	wait.v	wait	v	It has not been a well-known school for any part of the span the other Ivies have enjoyed . However much football has been over-emphasized , the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by the scoreboard , so , while Yale need never give its record a thought again since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888 , Dartmouth had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national recognition . It has come on with a rush in more significant areas .	66
wait.v.48	wait.v	wait	v	The aborigines fastened upon it with a concentration beyond pathos . Watching , they waited until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant across the dry burning land . At once the whole band set off at a lope .	14
wait.v.49	wait.v	wait	v	His letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on Sunday , and I came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve . He was waiting . My wish to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work .	28
wait.v.50	wait.v	wait	v	`` I hated the war '' , he said , `` but thought I ought to go because I was , perhaps , one of those who had n't done enough to prevent it '' . In June , 1940 , Sergeant Helion , with a company of reserve troops waiting to go into battle , was sketching the hills south of the Loire River , when the war suddenly rolled in upon him . Its first apparition was a long , gloomy column of refugees riding in farm wagons , or pushing prams .	50
wait.v.51	wait.v	wait	v	With scarcely a mumble of excuse , I fled . I fled , however , not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to disguise from you that the things about my bridegroom -- in the sense you meant the word `` things '' -- which you had been galvanizing yourself to tell me as a painful part of your maternal duty were things which I had already insisted upon finding out for myself -LRB- despite , I may now say , the unspeakable awkwardness of making the discovery on principle , yes , on principle , and in cold blood -RRB- because I was resolved , as a modern woman , not to be a mollycoddle waiting for Life but to seize Life by the throat . I had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid of self-betrayal .	121
wait.v.52	wait.v	wait	v	`` Well , there 's time , in any case . We 'll wait till you 're stronger and then talk about it '' . She put the slipper neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed .	13
wait.v.53	wait.v	wait	v	Smiling at his quixotic thoughts , Warren turned back from the opening and lit a cigarette before sitting down . Tonight a group of men , tomorrow night he himself , would go out there somewhere and wait . If he were to go with White , he would be out there two days , not just listening in the dark at some point between here and Papa-san , but moving ever deeper into enemy land -- behind Papa-san -- itself .	37
wait.v.54	wait.v	wait	v	Prevot had briefed the two new men that afternoon . `` We just sit quiet and wait '' , Prevot had said . `` Be sure the man nearest you is awake .	16
wait.v.55	wait.v	wait	v	He took the pen in his stumps and began to write . `` Wait ! ! Wait '' ! ! Cried the guard who ran from the hut to shout to other men standing about outside . They crowded the small room and peered over one another 's shoulders to watch the handless man write his name in the book .	13
wait.v.56	wait.v	wait	v	He took the pen in his stumps and began to write . `` Wait ! ! Wait '' ! ! Cried the guard who ran from the hut to shout to other men standing about outside . They crowded the small room and peered over one another 's shoulders to watch the handless man write his name in the book .	13
wait.v.57	wait.v	wait	v	Smiling at Warren 's protestations , the old monk took his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor . `` Will you please wait in here .	29
wait.v.58	wait.v	wait	v	But then his son could afford it . Lawrence was waiting for Bill Boxell . The Vice President had called and asked if he could see the Secretary at his home .	10
wait.v.59	wait.v	wait	v	When the skies grew dark and thunder rolled across the valley , he was unafraid . Aggie might fly into a closet , shut the door and bury her head in the clothes ; ; he dared to wait for the lightning . Lightning could strike you blind if you were a sinner ! !	38
wait.v.60	wait.v	wait	v	And he took heart ; ; the final word came forth . Now he heard it , fully ; ; `` bout takin his place '' He listened , waited , nothing happened . He felt good .	29
wait.v.61	wait.v	wait	v	I know that I myself felt that it was a mortal shame for a man to be torn open by a British musket ball , as Isaac had been , yet I also felt relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself . I was drunk with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that came floating down from the road , and the fact that I was not afraid now , but only waiting to know what to do next . Meanwhile , I reloaded my gun , as the other men were doing .	76
wait.v.62	wait.v	wait	v	The suitcases had come while they were out , and had been put in their room , the concierge said . He waited until they were inside the elevator and then said : `` Now what do we do '' ? ? `` Call the Vouillemont , I guess '' .	22
wait.v.63	wait.v	wait	v	`` I guess '' . Rather than sit around waiting for the suitcases to be delivered , they had gone sight-seeing . They went to the Flea Market , expecting to find the treasures of Europe , and found instead a duplication of that long double row of booths in Tours .	9
wait.v.64	wait.v	wait	v	No one went much to the crossroads now except Uncle Randolph . They stayed in their own world on the bluff , waiting for letters and the peddler , bringing the news . Jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction of Harpers Ferry before they abandoned it ; ; of their first engagement at Falling Waters after Old Jack 's First Brigade had destroyed all the rolling stock of the B & O Railroad .	22
wait.v.65	wait.v	wait	v	Jonathan and Ben were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing . Kate and Mrs. Tussle waited for letters anxiously . Joel went to the crest of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate .	22
wait.v.66	wait.v	wait	v	The captain 's gig of H.M.S. Mercury was being rowed to H.M.S. Neptune . On shore `` the freed slaves to despotism '' -- the town dwellers -- watched the ships and waited . The chevaux de frise , those sharp stakes and barriers around the fort at the Battery , pointed to a conflict between the town and sea power rolling in glassy swells as the tide came in .	32
wait.v.67	wait.v	wait	v	The fish hawk flew on and was lost from sight . The British ships rolled at anchor , sent out picket boats and waited for orders from London . Waited for more ships , more lobster-backed infantry , and asked what was to be done with a war of rebellion ? ?	23
wait.v.68	wait.v	wait	v	The British ships rolled at anchor , sent out picket boats and waited for orders from London . Waited for more ships , more lobster-backed infantry , and asked what was to be done with a war of rebellion ? ? David Cortlandt , having slept away a day and a night , came awake in a plank farmhouse on the Harlem River near Spuyten Duyvil .	18
wait.v.69	wait.v	wait	v	Styka sat beside him and pumped his hand excitedly . `` I have been waiting across the street at the post office since dawn . I thought you might get in on a morning train '' .	14
wait.v.70	wait.v	wait	v	For once radicalism was a recommendation . Sposato could n't wait to get me hired . With my gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance I certainly looked the honest working stiff .	10
wait.v.71	wait.v	wait	v	Rector had no doubt that Hino would come back from the village bursting with information , ready to impart it with his customary gusto , liberally embellished with his active imagnation . When the telephone rang on the day after Hino went down to the village , Rector had a hunch it would be Hino with some morsel of information too important to wait until his return , for there were few telephones in the village and the phone in Rector 's office rarely rang unless it was important . He was surprised to find Kayabashi 's secretary on the other end of the line .	63
wait.v.72	wait.v	wait	v	At two thirty he sent Fujimoto to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed the approach of Kayabashi 's party . Then Rector , attired in his best blue serge suit , sat in a chair out on the lawn , in the shade of a tree , smoking a cigarette and waiting . The air was cooler here , and the lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass , an effect which he found pleasant .	73
wait.v.73	wait.v	wait	v	When Napoleon 's ship had borne him to Elba , French wines had started to cross the Channel , the first shipments in a dozen war-ridden years , but the supplies had not yet reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the Spanish peninsula still ruled . As they waited for supper they sat by the fire , glasses in hand , while Byron philosophized as much for his own entertainment as hers . `` Sex is overpriced '' , he said .	50
wait.v.74	wait.v	wait	v	Despite his yearning , the colonel would not go down to see the men come through the lines . He would remain in the tent , waiting impatiently , occupied by some trivial task . -- Beckworth .	26
wait.v.75	wait.v	wait	v	Someone had hauled him over the side , and he had remained silent while they crossed . An officer with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank . The men in the boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer , two of them calling him Billy .	26
wait.v.76	wait.v	wait	v	`` Your wife just called '' , she said , separating one word from another , exactly like a child . `` And I am not sure that I have any cash -- any money , that is -- but if you will wait just a minute I will write you out a check if I can find my checkbook . Wo n't you step into the living room , where it 's cozier '' ? ?	43
wait.v.77	wait.v	wait	v	At the end of the room there was a desk heaped with papers , and she began to riffle these , making sighs and and noises of girlish exasperation . `` I am terribly sorry to keep you waiting '' , she said , `` but wo n't you make yourself a little drink while you wait ? ? Everything 's on the table '' .	38
wait.v.78	wait.v	wait	v	At the end of the room there was a desk heaped with papers , and she began to riffle these , making sighs and and noises of girlish exasperation . `` I am terribly sorry to keep you waiting '' , she said , `` but wo n't you make yourself a little drink while you wait ? ? Everything 's on the table '' .	38
wait.v.79	wait.v	wait	v	`` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , shaking their dresses down over their white shoulders . `` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , waiting for the elevator in the hotel corridor . `` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , pouring another whiskey .	35
wait.v.80	wait.v	wait	v	He saw the Starbird as she lay , her slender mast up and gently turning , its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus sky . Both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting , ready , for the two of them to run up her sails . The Starbird had been long at the bottom of the bay .	40
wait.v.81	wait.v	wait	v	Then , when he had it pointed down the hill , he stopped to gaze at her through the window . She had begun to turn back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell . He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once .	41
wait.v.82	wait.v	wait	v	Then she fell asleep again as soddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes . She stood up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming in or going out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in a moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests . She went into the living room and turned on three lamps , then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn , illuminating the driveway .	123
wait.v.83	wait.v	wait	v	It was the doctor , dressed and ready for the expedition to the market , and Alex was obliged to prepare himself in haste . The doctor stood about , waiting for Alex to dress , with a show of impatience , and soon they were moving , as quietly as could be , through the still-dark hallways , past the bedroom of the patronne , and so into the street . The market was not far and , once there , the doctor 's sense of immediacy left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him .	30
wait.v.84	wait.v	wait	v	It was evident that a second transfer had to be effected , and that it had to take place between the time the fille finished the doctor 's room and the time she began Alex 's . They waited three minutes and then crept out on tip-toe ; ; the halls were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine and listened at the door . A bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows being arranged indicated the fille de chambre 's presence inside ; ; they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced another important fact .	38
wait.v.85	wait.v	wait	v	`` Four years '' ! ! She wailed . `` That 's a long time , waiting '' . `` How many times have I told you '' -- he began , and was almost glad when she cut him off -- `` Too many times '' ! ! -- and flounced to the sink , where she began noisily to wash her hands .	16
wait.v.86	wait.v	wait	v	Winston had heard because he was setting up the liquor tray in the next room . Through the door , he had seen Mr. Jack walking around , waiting for Miss Ada . Finally she had come down ; ; Winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown .	28
wait.v.87	wait.v	wait	v	I looked away . I looked for Jessica to materialize out of the clogging , curdling crowd and , as the time passed and I waited , a fiend came to life beside me and whispered in my ear : How was I planning to greet Jessica ? ? Where exactly would we go after the movie ? ?	25
wait.v.88	wait.v	wait	v	It seemed to me that I was not only unlucky but quite stupid as well . I knew that I 'd soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital or as a counterman at Union News or Schraffts while waiting for another acting job to open . It suddenly occurred to me that I did not particularly like acting , that I was at some sort of crossroads and would have to decide soon what I was going to do with my life .	41
wait.v.89	wait.v	wait	v	`` That 's right '' . `` Mr. Wycoff 's car is waiting for you at the east entrance '' . I followed him out through the lobby to the street .	12
wait.v.90	wait.v	wait	v	I put in new batteries so as to be certain I 'd have plenty of power and on my way out walked over to the regular parking stalls and stood looking at them thoughtfully . I waited until the parking attendant was busy with a customer , then slipped around the back of the car with license number JYM 114 , attached the electronic bug to the rear bumper and walked out . The attendant waved me on .	36
wait.v.91	wait.v	wait	v	The attendant waved me on . One of the hardest chores a detective has is hanging around on a city street , trying to make himself inconspicuous , keeping an eye on the entrance of an office building and waiting . For the first fifteen or twenty minutes it 's possible to be more or less interested in window displays , then in people passing by .	39
wait.v.92	wait.v	wait	v	You 're conscious of the fact that your feet hurt , that the city pavements are hard . I waited a solid two hours before my man came out of the office building . He came out alone .	19
wait.v.93	wait.v	wait	v	I made a big circle until I located the car parked at the curb in front of an apartment house . I found a parking place half a block away , sat in the car and waited . My quarry was in the apartment house for two hours .	36
wait.v.94	wait.v	wait	v	I remembered it was the Peeping Tom place . I waited until my man was coming out of the office with the key to a cabin before I went in to register . The card the man I was shadowing had filled out was still on the counter .	10
wait.v.95	wait.v	wait	v	I got in the car , drove down to the drive-in and ordered a couple of hamburgers with everything included , a cup of coffee and the fastest service possible . The place was n't particularly busy at that time of night , and the girl who was waiting on me , who was clothed in the tightest-fitting pair of slacks I had ever seen on a woman and a sweater that showed everything there was -- and there was lots of it -- wanted to be sociable . `` You really in a hurry , Handsome '' ? ? She asked .	48
wait.v.96	wait.v	wait	v	Rat-face at the counter was on his feet . The distance between where she stood and where Dave waited at the outside door was a hundred miles . Keeping her frightened gaze on the men at the counter , she began to feel her way to the door .	18
wait.v.97	wait.v	wait	v	This was Acey Squire , proprietor of the juke joint . Marty smiled at Squire pleasantly and said , `` There was a cab waiting for me here . Do you know where it might have gone '' ? ?	24
wait.v.98	wait.v	wait	v	If he backed against the fence , one of the cars would brush him as it passed , and he would be cruelly lacerated by the wire . He stumbled to the middle of the road and simply stood there , waiting for them , a perfect target . The cars must have had their gas pedals pushed down to the floor boards .	41
wait.v.99	wait.v	wait	v	If I 'd stayed , all that I 'd have got was four punctured tires and one busted head . Why did n't you wait at the Burch house ? ? You must 've known I 'd gone to get the sheriff .	24
wait.v.100	wait.v	wait	v	Those names mean anything to you '' ? ? `` Wait a minute , Mike . In Painter 's office this evening .	10
wait.v.101	wait.v	wait	v	They 've got no official standing on this side of the Bay . As soon as you find out if they are Geely and Harris , come on around to the lounge where I 'll be waiting '' . Shayne opened the door on his side and stepped out .	36
wait.v.102	wait.v	wait	v	Then hang up fast and come walking on down to the Perrin address . I 'll be waiting for you there '' . The bartender brought Rourke 's drink and Shayne laid a twenty-dollar bill on the bar .	17
wait.v.103	wait.v	wait	v	Eight , nine steps above him , Roberts had paused . Mickey paused with him , waiting , no longer impatient , trying now to think it out , do a little planning . He looked down over the banister at the hotel desk , with the telephone and pen set .	16
wait.v.104	wait.v	wait	v	They were eight feet apart when Roberts cleared the last step . Mickey waited with slack arms . `` Any time , Roberts '' , he said .	13
wait.v.105	wait.v	wait	v	And even if he 'd somehow missed seeing him , he would n't have gone off and left the light on and door open in the file room . Whoever it was had meant to shut him up in here , had followed him and waited till the courthouse and square were deserted . But why ? ?	45
wait.v.106	wait.v	wait	v	I go over to Castro and get fixed up there . I ca n't wait no two weeks '' . And Mr. Skyros did n't like Angie , but what with Prettyman and three of his boys inside , and not likely to come out -- And Angie such a valuable salesman , Prettyman said -- All the nuisance and danger of getting in touch with practically a whole new bunch of boys -- Why did everything have to happen at once ? ?	14
wait.v.107	wait.v	wait	v	Grab , snatch , I saw that first ! ! And , Here , I 'll take this , I was before her , you wait on me now or I do n't bother with it , see ! ! This kind of place She 'd be through here , just no time at all -- leave this kind of thing 'way behind .	25
wait.v.108	wait.v	wait	v	Money -- a lot of money , enough . She 'd be smart about it , get him to give it to her in little bills so 's nobody would suspect -- maybe could n't get it until Monday account of that , the banks -- But that was n't really long to wait . Not when she 'd waited so long already .	53
wait.v.109	wait.v	wait	v	She 'd be smart about it , get him to give it to her in little bills so 's nobody would suspect -- maybe could n't get it until Monday account of that , the banks -- But that was n't really long to wait . Not when she 'd waited so long already . No need say anything at all to the old woman .	50
wait.v.110	wait.v	wait	v	She felt cold and hot , sticky and chilly at the same time . Now wait a minute , she told herself , think about it ; ; Lucien is not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee . She had lost a bottle of opium -- but that was on the trip from New Orleans .	15
wait.v.111	wait.v	wait	v	They were all three bent over a shabby riding boot ; ; George had a tack hammer . Lolotte held a patch of leather , Rev steadied something , a tiny brad , waiting for George 's poised hammer . George said , `` First thing I do when I get to Vicksburg again , is get me a Yankee '' -- `` With boots on '' , Lolotte laughed softly .	33
wait.v.112	wait.v	wait	v	He simply walked , not noticing where he was , not caring . He stopped automatically at the street corners , waiting for the traffic lights to change , unheeding of other people , his coat open and flapping . As he walked , he tried to think .	21
wait.v.113	wait.v	wait	v	She was his goal , she was his reason . He had lived all his life waiting for her . Not once , in the time that he had known her , had he ever considered the possibility , not once , not for one one-thousandth of a second , of her infidelity .	16
wait.v.114	wait.v	wait	v	She had invited him in for coffee . It was in the kitchen , as she was watching the kettle , waiting for the water to boil , that he had grabbed for her . Without warning , without giving her a chance to prepare for it .	21
wait.v.115	wait.v	wait	v	The man was just this side of being a freak . We waited till he had finished laughing , and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him . He was dressed in a manner Esquire might suggest for the outdoor man 's country weekend .	12
wait.v.116	wait.v	wait	v	Nothing new . Lot of people waiting to see you , though '' . `` Reporters '' ? ?	6
wait.v.117	wait.v	wait	v	He instructed Shirl Winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted on the call board . Bake was waiting to report that Lou DuVol had been sobered up to the point where he could function efficiently . Andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment .	20
wait.v.118	wait.v	wait	v	`` Someday '' , Bonner said , `` you 're going to ask us for help . I can hardly wait '' . `` What you do n't understand is that I 'm asking for it now '' .	20
wait.v.119	wait.v	wait	v	Thornburg added in a lower voice but Andy overheard , `` They act more like a jury than an audience '' . Andy said , `` Well , I guess we ca n't wait any longer . Hub , you stick by the stage door .	33
wait.v.120	wait.v	wait	v	`` Dad . Dad , wait '' . He caught up with the old man in the living room .	5
wait.v.121	wait.v	wait	v	He does n't expect you until five '' . `` Then I 'd better wait until five '' . `` No-o-o .	14
wait.v.122	wait.v	wait	v	Once out in the street , the traffic was a gadfly maze in which he wandered stricken . When he turned into the highway that led to the outskirts of the city and then rose toward home , he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a few minutes , sucking in air and squinting and blinking his eyes to clear them of tears . What on earth was in Mae 's mind , that she wanted him up there spying on what the cops were doing ? ?	47
wait.v.123	wait.v	wait	v	Cooper was beside his car , on the curb at the right , just standing there morosely ; ; he did n't even look up . Behind him on the steps of the little office sat old man Arthur ; ; he was straight , something angry in his attitude , as if he might be waiting to report something . Holden stepped on the gas .	56
wait.v.124	wait.v	wait	v	`` No . Wait a minute . What do you '' --	3
wait.v.125	wait.v	wait	v	He had left after the scuffle ; ; had been seen to leave . He would have had ample time to go into a blind somewhere and wait his prey . Consider him seriously , therefore ? ?	27
wait.v.126	wait.v	wait	v	`` Well '' ? ? Griffith said , `` Hoag told me to tell you '' -- he waited until they were close ; ; it was hideously embarrassing -- `` not to let the prime minister be alone with Mahzeer '' . Griffith looked half-crocked to the captain ; ; it would be just like him .	18
wait.v.127	wait.v	wait	v	Mahzeer , of course , would be desolate . How was he to suspect that an assassin had been lurking somewhere across the street waiting for just such a chance ? ? Hoag turned .	24
wait.v.128	wait.v	wait	v	Where across the street ? ? Where was Muller waiting with the rifle ? ? Narrow four-story buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf .	9
wait.v.129	wait.v	wait	v	But dully glinting on the dark form were the buttons and badge of a policeman . With a cop patrolling the road Muller would have to be inside a building -- if he was here at all , and not waiting for the prime minister somewhere between this street and the terminal building at La Guardia Airport . Hoag crossed the narrow street , squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk .	40
wait.v.130	wait.v	wait	v	Killpath peered through half-closed lids at his reflection , thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and about-faced . Gun waited for Killpath to sit down behind the desk near the window . He sat stiff-backed in a chair that did not swivel , though it was obvious to Gun that Killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly merited a swivel chair .	22
wait.v.131	wait.v	wait	v	He put his chin on his kneecap , stretching his neck like that of a turkey on a chopping block , and stared wordlessly at his sergeant . Gun waited . The 7:45 bell rang and he could hear the outside doors bang shut , closing in the assembled day watch .	29
wait.v.132	wait.v	wait	v	It was almost one and I had n't had lunch . Still , I wanted to get this over with , had a lot of paper work waiting in my own office . I told him , `` I want to go see the Buck house '' .	27
wait.v.133	wait.v	wait	v	I drove out of the Harbor , turned off into a dirt road among the scrub pine trees and stopped . I waited a few minutes and she sat up . For another moment we did n't talk , then she began to weep .	22
wait.v.134	wait.v	wait	v	`` I 'm betting on that chance . Interview the bellboy and chambermaid who waited on Beauclerk . Study the topography of the suite .	14
wait.v.135	wait.v	wait	v	Something heavy shook the floor as it dropped . Alec waited a moment , on guard . Nothing happened .	10
wait.v.136	wait.v	wait	v	He really did n't take the offer seriously , but he began to feel uneasy . When he finally got the coughing under control , he realized that Pete -LRB- all he gave was his first name -RRB- was still waiting for an answer -- he did n't even seem to wink as he continued to stare . Haney managed a weak laugh .	40
wait.v.137	wait.v	wait	v	I think I can manage one more favor for you '' . He waited eagerly . Haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass .	13
wait.v.138	wait.v	wait	v	When yuh come back I 'll put it out agin till you 're both inside '' . Charlie was waiting , leaning against a building front . `` Perfect set-up '' , I told him .	19
wait.v.139	wait.v	wait	v	I was reminded , amusedly , by a poem of Kenneth Patchen 's called The Murder of Two Men by a Young Kid Wearing Lemon Colored Gloves , which Patchen himself read on a record against jazz background . The poem consisted of only two words , the word `` Wait '' , repeated over and over at irregular intervals and with different inflections , and then the word `` Now '' ! ! And a blaring final chord from the jazz group .	50
wait.v.140	wait.v	wait	v	This was the same , except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither of us was wearing gloves . But we could wait all right ; ; there was no hurry . I said , `` Wait wait '' to Charlie and he grinned , digging the reference .	28
wait.v.141	wait.v	wait	v	But we could wait all right ; ; there was no hurry . I said , `` Wait wait '' to Charlie and he grinned , digging the reference . We 'd heard the record together once .	17
wait.v.142	wait.v	wait	v	But we could wait all right ; ; there was no hurry . I said , `` Wait wait '' to Charlie and he grinned , digging the reference . We 'd heard the record together once .	17
wait.v.143	wait.v	wait	v	About halfway through the second bottle , Charlie looked at me across Pops , who was sitting between us and asked `` Now '' ? ? I said , `` Wait '' , and handed the bottle to Pops for his final drink . When he handed it back and I had hold of it safely , Pops was looking toward me and I said `` Now '' , to Charlie and he swung the short length of lead pipe he 'd meanwhile taken from his pocket , once .	30
wait.v.144	wait.v	wait	v	Out cold , if not dead ; ; and he 'd never known what hit him -- he 'd never known that anything had hit him . I reached my hand toward him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a heartbeat , but Charlie said `` Wait '' ! ! -- and said it sharply , not as in the Patchen bit , but as an order -- so I stopped my hand and looked at him . He was holding the piece of lead pipe out to me .	49
wait.v.145	wait.v	wait	v	Or would you rather deal a hand of show-down poker or play a game of gin rummy , or what '' ? ? `` Wait a minute , Charlie '' , I said . `` One thing we have n't discussed , expense money .	24
wait.v.146	wait.v	wait	v	I 'll go to bat first . You 'd have to wait till Seaton 's back from Mexico City and also while I set it up with Doris to have her have an alibi for D-night . So it would n't be for days or even a week before you could do anything .	11
wait.v.147	wait.v	wait	v	Unfortunately '' Hal waited : Macneff paced some more , frowning . Then , he said , `` Unfortunately , only one lamechian linguist exists , and he is too old for this expedition .	3
wait.v.148	wait.v	wait	v	He had already become used to Hesperus ' snapping back answers to questions almost before Jack could get them asked . There was nothing he could do but wait . The dice were cast .	28
wait.v.149	wait.v	wait	v	The sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive . `` No directives from Central is scarcely a cause for regret , but there happen to be eight other guys biting their fingernails to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you , you beautiful thing '' .	39
wait.v.150	wait.v	wait	v	Formerly he had noticed them -- now he felt them . He tried to ask the Lady Da how long they had had the drug , and how much longer they would have to wait before they had it again . She smiled at him with benign , remote happiness ; ; apparently her many torsos , stretched out along the ground , had a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body .	34
wait.v.151	wait.v	wait	v	Now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly , staggering , as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet . Reaching the house ahead of them , he waited with his Winchester in his hands . They crawled through the north fence and came on toward him , and now he saw that both were young , not more than nineteen or twenty .	38
wait.v.152	wait.v	wait	v	`` Hold your fire '' , Montero was shouting . `` Wait until my shot . I 'll shoot the first man who does n't '' .	11
wait.v.153	wait.v	wait	v	The circle came nearer and nearer . My God , how long is he going to wait , I thought . Montero 's rifle cracked .	16
wait.v.154	wait.v	wait	v	`` For Christ 's sake , do n't waste your powder on one of 'em '' ! ! Montero shouted furiously . `` Wait for the charge ! ! The charge , I tell you '' ! !	23
wait.v.155	wait.v	wait	v	Montero 's shot had caught him high in the chest ; ; there was no doubt he was dying . Again we waited for Montero . This time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically , but they held their fire .	22
wait.v.156	wait.v	wait	v	And one had been too many . He watched the girl until she had gone into the trees , and waited until he could n't hear the sound of her horse any longer , then went up to where the children were sleeping . They were n't sleeping , of course , but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending .	20
wait.v.157	wait.v	wait	v	Drifting here and there . Squatting , as if waiting . The pulsing glow of a cigarette .	9
wait.v.158	wait.v	wait	v	Later I would remember what this pompous little man had told me about the worth of a ticket . Having nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be processed , I gave myself over to speculations concerning the hall itself . When suitably lighted , what would it look like ? ?	25
wait.v.159	wait.v	wait	v	When they learn you 're in the hills though , they 'll rally , do n't worry about that '' . Barton waited for a long moment , then asked the question which lay always uppermost in his mind . `` My boy .	22
wait.v.160	wait.v	wait	v	That 's what they 'll expect you to do . They 'll be there waiting for you . I understand how you feel about the child . ''	14
wait.v.161	wait.v	wait	v	Silence walked at Pamela 's side , its presence numbingly close , yet too far for her to hear . Silence stood in front of her , waiting , and in back of her , blocking her retreat . She stumbled over the root of a tree that protruded maliciously above the earth .	27
wait.v.162	wait.v	wait	v	He opened the door and got out . He waited at the car side for a moment , looking down at her expectantly . `` Well ? ?	9
wait.v.163	wait.v	wait	v	That was the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of Big Sands with Aaron McBride , field boss for the Highlands Oil & Gas Company . Tom had been laying for Aaron McBride for a long time , just waiting to catch him out of line . McBride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip .	43
wait.v.164	wait.v	wait	v	`` Let 's hear it , anyway '' . `` Wait a little while . Let Senora Brannon live in her father 's house for a time .	10
wait.v.165	wait.v	wait	v	Ten ? ? How long should I wait '' ? ? `` Maybe in a year , Tomas . ''	7
wait.v.166	wait.v	wait	v	Red , come along . The rest of you wait here '' . With Red Hogan , he rode to the Welcome Cafe .	9
wait.v.167	wait.v	wait	v	It seemed long , at least to Tom Brannon . He and Hogan waited by the door , one to either side . Macklin was the third man to come out , and he came unhurriedly .	13
wait.v.168	wait.v	wait	v	He slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly , its hoofs rattling the side of the stall . Curt moved over beside the door and waited . Presently he heard footsteps crossing the yard , and Jess 's smothered curses .	26
wait.v.169	wait.v	wait	v	And now she could see him , looking uncommon handsome , standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon . Seeing them waiting there at the foot of Emigrant Rock was so overwhelming that , for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them , Matilda could not speak at all . Then , with a glory that almost wiped out the deep , downward sags in her careworn face , Matilda leaned over the wheel and shouted to Hez , who was stumbling along in the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon	28
wait.v.170	wait.v	wait	v	`` But honest-to-Betsy , I 've seed more hair than that on a piece o ' bacon '' . The two tall brothers waited silently while their mother handed Gran her cold snack and water jug , placed the chamber pot beside her feet , and returned to her place at the front of the wagon with Alice . `` Rheumatics worse , Pa '' ? ? Dan asked Hez , who had limped back from his team to hold the notched-stick chair braces in place while his boys swung up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends .	23
wait.v.171	wait.v	wait	v	`` But the sun 'll fry it out'n me onct we git to rolling '' . The three men stepped out to the side to wait for Captain Clemens ' signal . Hez looked up at the high face of Emigrant Rock , official signboard for the Raft River turnoff , and gloated , `` Seems funny that them Burnsides never took time to leave their John-Henry up thar '' .	25
wait.v.172	wait.v	wait	v	`` Sally and her ma want to trade off on account of Harmony being so far along '' , Dan explained . `` Jackson recruited his critters , and him and me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up . He 's got the tightest running gear in the train now .	39
wait.v.173	wait.v	wait	v	Besides , 't- ai n't no more 'n right for me to follow with my black oxen , so 's I can unhook and pull up fast if either of you get in a pinch '' . Captain Clemens ' signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting teams . `` Reckon ye 're right , Dan '' , Hez called back over his shoulder .	48
wait.v.174	wait.v	wait	v	Donovan snatched Greg 's chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it . His face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot . Greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before .	36
wait.v.175	wait.v	wait	v	A hell of an altitude for a barrel roll , but it could be done . Greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and rammed up the RPM , and the engine responded as if it had been waiting . The clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around .	39
wait.v.176	wait.v	wait	v	It was her first smile . But worth waiting for . `` Sure '' . I said .	8
wait.v.177	wait.v	wait	v	Mmmm , it sure itches '' . `` You might as well wait here while I 'm gone , so you can use my shower if you 'd like '' . `` Oh , I 'd love to '' .	12
wait.v.178	wait.v	wait	v	I loved the city and I particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of Mardi Gras . I had seen two of them and we would soon be in another city-wide , joyous celebration with romance in the air ; ; and , when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting around the next corner . The very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure .	58
wait.v.179	wait.v	wait	v	The very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure . It was as if they could hardly wait to get into their costumes , cover their faces with masks and go adventuring . My Uncle and I were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages .	21
wait.v.180	wait.v	wait	v	For several weeks we eyed one another almost like sparring partners , and then one day Uncle was slightly indisposed and stayed home ; ; his bride opened the store . I was waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my Uncle 's indisposition . Even as she was telling me about it I became aware of a give-away flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks , and subconsciously I realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights .	33
wait.v.181	wait.v	wait	v	No . Smiling , she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched . The sun grew hotter as it approached the midday .	11
wait.v.182	wait.v	wait	v	In the bedroom before the husband and wife find their way to the bed , the lights go on : `` In dull domestic radiance I watch her staring face , still blind , Start wincing in obedience To dirty waters , counters , pots and pans , Waiting below stairs , in her mind '' . Mary Jane took the page from him and began reading it , moving her lips with the words .	48
wait.v.183	wait.v	wait	v	You shall have food , water and rest '' . Thirty minutes later , the outrigger grated on sand and other girls , waiting on shore , rushed forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with vine ropes to a large boulder . I saw a dozen or so other outriggers moored there .	23
wait.v.184	wait.v	wait	v	Artie had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger . He waited awhile before he said , `` Roy , you know your decompression table , do n't you '' ? ? `` You know I know it '' , Robinson answered warily .	15
wait.v.185	wait.v	wait	v	Matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground , out of the marine 's reach and away from their shadows . He waited in his squat , gripping the hair . Every so often he turned the knife .	28
wait.v.186	wait.v	wait	v	The two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door . `` Wait here , Neal '' , said Tilghman . `` If I do n't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse '' .	14
wait.v.187	wait.v	wait	v	He could not keep his eyes off her when at school ; ; when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do . When he awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh . Miss Langford -LRB- her first name was Evelyn -RRB- was an attractive girl .	71
wait.v.188	wait.v	wait	v	They lapsed into silence , and the freight wallowed up a hill , scooted down the other side , shaking and clanking to itself . After a while , Kitty murmured something to Cappy , and he held her close , answering , `` We 'll just have to wait till we pull into Philly , honey '' . `` What 's the matter , she wan- na go the bathroom '' ? ?	49
wait.v.189	wait.v	wait	v	The Old Man silently fed upon these streets . They kept him alive , waiting . Waiting for what and for whom , only he could tell and would not .	14
wait.v.190	wait.v	wait	v	They kept him alive , waiting . Waiting for what and for whom , only he could tell and would not . It was as though he had made a pact with the devil himself , but it was not yet time to pay the price .	7
wait.v.191	wait.v	wait	v	This -- trip of his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants , and I am going to see that everybody at Mt. Pleasant understands that simple fact . Wait for me , Laban , I 'll be dressed in half a second '' ! ! Frank followed her into the bedroom , hooked her dress up the back .	31
wait.v.192	wait.v	wait	v	Now she must be thinking of a boy-name , something special . Just wait till she saw the Mare 's foal . Handsomest colt in all Kentucky .	13
wait.v.193	wait.v	wait	v	Before anything else , she would go to Doaty 's grave with flowers from Doaty 's forgotten garden . Everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards . She closed her eyes , remembering the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls .	21
wait.v.194	wait.v	wait	v	It had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray . After the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window . The garden below was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness .	21
wait.v.195	wait.v	wait	v	Now , some of the acknowledgments were cautious , but all were interested . An old man , sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him , gave her a more than reflective look as she passed , the sap still plainly rising in his branches . On an impulse , she turned back and said good morning .	26
wait.v.196	wait.v	wait	v	They had turned numb and prickly in the classroom . The old man in the baggy clothes waited at the foot of the steps . He glanced down into his beard and muttered something in Yiddish .	17
wait.v.197	wait.v	wait	v	When we were fighting , a few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass . They said that we must not fight but wait for the Messiah '' . I was amazed .	31
wait.v.198	wait.v	wait	v	Or you could wish your daddy would really do it -- kill Gratt Shafer like he said when you all the time , all along , could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night . So you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights , waiting for you , for your new spectator pumps , waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt , crying and afraid and trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch tire off , because that is being an old maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it is changing the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , hating to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help . And every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you wo n't tell , a combination like ham and eggs , rape her and kill her , and that is being an old maid too .	85

wait.v.200	wait.v	wait	v	She could not count the times Herman had rapped on the door , just a couple of bangs that shook the whole damned closet and might , someday , break away the pipe connections from the wall . The two little bangs meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would jerk open the door and drag out , by the opposite door handle which she would be clutching , whichever-the-hell clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot . And the hours were six-thirty in the morning until eleven at night on Saturdays and during sales , and there were no chairs and you could n't smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no porter or janitor .	54
wait.v.201	wait.v	wait	v	Even at a car 's length I could sense that something was wrong , and so I followed her up to the turnaround in front of the house . Dolly Engisch was waiting there on the steps and she came running toward us . `` She 's nowhere , nowhere '' ! ! She screamed , and both women ran up to the house , and I followed .	32
wait.v.202	wait.v	wait	v	The funeral service was in the house , the Methodist minister , how clean and glistening his eyeglasses and his neat body standing beside that coffin with that doll inside , a stranger speaking to strangers the old sacred words , and the rain drumming incessantly in accompaniment , seven days of relentless rain that turned the ground to mud so the burial had to be postponed . I waited . Then Via called to say they had decided to cremate her -- as they had Ellen , the thought leaped to my mind -- and did I want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning .	69
wait.v.203	wait.v	wait	v	Via was in the parking lot when I went outside . Together we waited in her car until the hearse moved out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of New Jersey . By the time we arrived and entered the building sacred music was already swelling out into the chapel-like auditorium with its discreet symbols of religious faiths .	13
wait.v.204	wait.v	wait	v	But I think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with '' . Pausing , he waited for her to turn , to ask a question . She showed no interest at all in the life he had led back home , and it hurt him a little .	19
wait.v.205	wait.v	wait	v	`` Since we 're having coffee with them this afternoon '' , he said , `` I think I 'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us '' . And he waited for her to say , `` Oh , no , I can do it , Sam . There 's so little to do '' .	41
wait.v.206	wait.v	wait	v	He cried out to her , his back turned . Then he fled , not waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry . But she heard him go .	15
wait.v.207	wait.v	wait	v	Yet she did not hesitate and only turned slightly , her neck tall as she looked in his direction , and continued on her way toward the end of the camp . Elsewhere others heard and stopped and waited , the women peering from their lodges then gathering in small , curious clusters .

Standing there she saw Shades of Night come through the trees and stop beside the lodge , silent , almost imperious , her body taut , simply standing without speaking or moving while the wife of Walitzee waited , perhaps denying the dread that moved in her . When at last she could suffer the insult no longer , nor face the girl 's scorn , she said in a voice overloud : `` I shall call your father ! !	72
wait.v.209	wait.v	wait	v	Then , without knowing why , she found herself running from them , fleeing wildly through the trees , dodging her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and hid , listening to the madness of her heart and wanting for once to cry . For a while the young men waited outside the lodge of TuHulHulZote , glorying in his harsh language as he talked with himself . He shouted like a hoarse old mastiff , his hair stiff and bristling .	68
wait.v.210	wait.v	wait	v	`` No -- nothing at all '' , he said after a moment 's hesitation . `` I 'll just wait for you here '' . He leaned his head against the wood paneling behind him , but the vivid red images of pain inserted themselves against his eyelids .	20
wait.v.211	wait.v	wait	v	There were new yellow curtains , bright as a child 's life ought to be , a new bedspread , lively with hopping rabbits , and hanging from the ceiling was an airy Mother Goose Mobile , spinning slowly in the breeze . A row of little hangers waited for a child 's clothes in the neatly empty closet ; ; since Myra had always put most of Greg 's money on her own back , Lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed . The closet was faintly fragrant with lavender , and as Lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into her mind , like a lavender ghost : Greg 's house , on the day he was buried , and the child , pale , silent , baffled , watching the funeral guests with panicky eyes .	48
wait.v.212	wait.v	wait	v	In the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the promise spilled out . `` You just wait , Dad . When you get back I 'll probly be swimming better than Victoria .	21
wait.v.213	wait.v	wait	v	When you get back I 'll probly be swimming better than Victoria . Wait and see , Dad '' . Victoria was fourteen months younger than Quint , a head taller , and could lick any boy or girl on the beach .	13
wait.v.214	wait.v	wait	v	It would be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of . Linda would have to wait , she knew . But what was a decent six months or so after the more than twenty years gone by ? ?	21
wait.v.215	wait.v	wait	v	So I told her Mrs. Roberts would pay her in the morning , and she scooted off to her own apartment . After I looked in at Francie , I went into the living room and waited . I must have dozed off , because I came to with a start at the sound of voices .	36
wait.v.216	wait.v	wait	v	`` I 'd had all this trouble with the old man , that 's why I drank so much . I -- got fired yesterday for not attending to business '' -- Old Mr. Thom himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job , Wally confessed , and could n't get one because there were cars on the pits waiting to be repaired . Seems that the kid Wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side .	62
wait.v.217	wait.v	wait	v	Did he have a right to know the secret I 'd kept from Gladdy all these years ? ? The boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when I got to Fairview . Two interns and Dick Ishii , the other resident .	23
wait.v.218	wait.v	wait	v	The place was busy but I did n't feel like a Hun . I sat waiting for Life to come along and sweep me up . I had part of a bottle of French beer called Panther Pils -LRB- so help me -RRB- , then switched to Tuborg .	15
wait.v.219	wait.v	wait	v	`` I hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them . I may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best . '' I really should n't have smoked a cigarette so early in the day , thought Theresa , it always makes me sick .	29
wait.v.220	wait.v	wait	v	She might peel him , once the worst of the agony was over . Charlie spent the next two days in his pajama bottoms , waiting for the fire in his back to subside , and used generous quantities of the hand lotion . Correspondence passed back and forth .	25
wait.v.221	wait.v	wait	v	I felt the anger mount within me . The boy waited at the corner , with the jar of water held up to me in his hands , and the water had grown bubbly in the heat of the morning . I knew the boy well .	10
wait.v.222	wait.v	wait	v	He was a beautiful boy , really , with finely-spun blonde hair and a smooth and still effeminate face , and his eyelashes were long and dark and brushlike , and his eyes were blue . He waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up , as he would smile on any other day . He was my nephew , my brother 's son , handsome and warm and newly-scrubbed , with happiness upon his face and his face resembled my brother 's and mine as well .	37
wait.v.223	wait.v	wait	v	So sorry . He suddenly realized when he walked into his own pretty darned expensive house that he needed the Martini Anne had waiting for him . But tonight his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket .	23
wait.v.224	wait.v	wait	v	He looks a little bit frayed '' . Anne waited until the door had slammed and picked up the coffeepot . `` Let 's go into the library .	9
wait.v.225	wait.v	wait	v	Here 's what I wrote '' . Cady handed her the letter , drank his coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence . Already he could feel Anne 's questioning eyes .	17
wait.v.226	wait.v	wait	v	They gave the room a strange note of incongruity , like a mole on a beautiful face . He saw that Dolores intended to wait until the last minute , thinking he would get nervous . Quietly he determined to foil her .	24
wait.v.227	wait.v	wait	v	`` It 's a little contest Martin and I have '' , she would begin gaily , carrying the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course . While he waited in the living room . Once Martin went along .	29
wait.v.228	wait.v	wait	v	Here are a few facts and figures I 've assembled . Ca n't you stay with what you have and wait till the dust settles '' ? ? Willis glanced at the bound pages given him and shrugged .	20
wait.v.229	wait.v	wait	v	Let 's make it moonlight and the call of far places and a seduction , at reasonable rates . Ticonderoga folded a few minutes too soon , before the tide changed , still honest and stupid -- and the network of dealers the company had is around waiting to be signed up again -- waiting for us , ready-made . We 've got rid of the steam yachts and Georgian houses , and the bloated , too-expensive automobile is next .	47

wait.v.231	wait.v	wait	v	Every new scandal which would provide more `` copy '' for Marshall 's pen would thus mean more publicity for Welch . I knew that both these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when Viola was called to the stand . Once there , the D.A. with devilish cleverness would provide Marshall with headlines : `` Viola 's Multiple Romances '' `` Viola Lake an Addict '' `` Downfall of Another Film Idol '' ! !	29
wait.v.232	wait.v	wait	v	During all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done . This habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do anything for which no one was waiting . He looked at the luminous dial of his wrist watch .	37
wait.v.233	wait.v	wait	v	`` Those are the things I can do , now that I 'm set up '' . `` I 've been waiting to get these things done for months '' , she said . `` We wo n't live long enough if I wait for you , besides which you do n't need to worry -- there 'll be plenty more '' .	21
wait.v.234	wait.v	wait	v	`` I 've been waiting to get these things done for months '' , she said . `` We wo n't live long enough if I wait for you , besides which you do n't need to worry -- there 'll be plenty more '' . But the discussion was academic .	26
wait.v.235	wait.v	wait	v	Maybe that was why they were cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability of Arlene . `` Just you wait '' , advised Arlene , echoing the dialogue in a recent British movie . And when they had got to their little lawn , they had had a most twirlingly magnificent time .	18
wait.v.236	wait.v	wait	v	They had protested that that was n't any surprise . `` Just you wait '' , said Arlene again , as though she were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations of that handy little sturdy statement . `` This is a warm-up '' .	13

[speaker#1] Jia Bangyou finally came back up to the surface safely .	54
wait.v.238	wait.v	wait	v	[speaker#1] Men , women , old and young were all at the mouth of the mine , not going anywhere .

Go see whether your families are still alive .	35

wait.v.290	wait.v	wait	v	The delay in getting AZT to children has been blamed on a combination of factors . Traditionally , the medical establishment has waited two years to approve adult treatments for pediatric uses , because of a combination of conservative safety standards and red tape .

So , following both the style he pursued as President Ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission , Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , gathering the views of the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence community ; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out . The Tower Commission specifically said that the NSC staff should be `` small '' and warned against letting `` energetic self-starters '' like Lt. Col.

However , for example , in France the strict machinery of justice is separated from the constitutional court , which is a separate body , but yes there also the members are appointed by the President and therefore there also , the members of the Coseque Constitutionalle are somewhat open to criticism that the decisions are often more motivated by politics than they are by the law . However , I think that the image that we Europeans had , of the American system and especially of the US Supreme Court , was that those justices were above politics and , I think , that is also one of the bad surprises that this election is reserving to us Europeans is that finally your system is not as perfect as we were led to believe .	29

The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium 's ESP may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in this drama must be separated . One way to do this is by `` proxy sittings '' , wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute , the proxy sitter .	69

He was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego , demanding to be satisfied , for the two were intertwined and could not be separated . He wanted desperately to see Kayabashi defeated , the Communists in the village rooted out , the mission standing triumphant , for in the triumph of the Lord he himself would be triumphant , too .	94

State engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns , wrenched and separated from the double-decker roadbed , that was responsible for the collapse .

In announcements to workers late last week , GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants , and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories .	20
signal.v.24	signal.v	signal	v	One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match .

Still , one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to entertain the notion , and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law .

signal.v.32	signal.v	signal	v	The decision was based solely on problems with the UAL management-pilot plan , they said .

slow.v.31	slow.v	slow	v	The market 's attention is especially focused on a preliminary report on the U.S. third-quarter gross national product , due out Thursday , which could show the economy is continuing to expand at a relatively brisk pace . The consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the U.S. output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a 2.3 % gain on an annual basis , slowing somewhat from the second quarter 's 2.5 % , but still fairly strong .

slow.v.54	slow.v	slow	v	He estimated it would be negative 0.5 percent , plus or minus . He said further that China 's economic growth would also slow in speed , feeling the effects of the economies of Japan and Asia being depressed and of the devaluation of these countries ' currencies .

question.v.8	question.v	question	v	It 's difficult to know how he would react . Kostunica has questioned the legality of the Hague Tribunal , and talked of trying Milosevic in Yugoslavia . Still , Kostunica 's grace period wo n't last forever .	12
question.v.9	question.v	question	v	As you start moving down this path towards technical innovation , it invites disruption or it brings about the conflict much quicker than I think most people would be prepared to start dealing with it . I think there is a lot of issues that Japan is starting to question , how do they adapt , how do they change , how do they preserve what is good about their society while making these changes to be more competitive with what 's happening throughout the rest of the world .	49
question.v.10	question.v	question	v	But critics question whether voters get cheated because the politicians would rather face comics than tough questions .	2
question.v.11	question.v	question	v	This has been a tough race , too , where Rick Lazio , the congressman of eight years from Long Island was accused of being much more tough as a campaigner -- A lot of mud was slung on both sides of this race , but when voters were questioned about that , they said -- 68 % that Mr. Lazio attacked unfairly , and 57 % said Mrs. Clinton did . So that 's some of the picture that makes up the results tonight that sent Hillary Rodham Clinton to Washington .	49

U.S. officials tell CNN bomb - making materials were found at an apartment in Yemen but gave no details .	24
question.v.13	question.v	question	v	So far , the investigation is still limited to this port city of Aden . One U.S. official said the numbers of those detained or being questioned is now in three figures . It 's still way too early to talk about American retaliation for the `` Cole '' , because it 's still not known who to retaliate against .	26
question.v.14	question.v	question	v	Yesterday 's CNN / `` USA Today '' / Gallup tracking poll shows Gore with a slight edge for the first time in two weeks . The new numbers show that if the election were held today , 46 % of the likely voters questioned would choose Gore . 45 % would choose Bush , but the pollsters say the change is statistically insignificant when the margin of error is considered .	44
question.v.15	question.v	question	v	They thanked the country for help in gathering forensic evidence , but say the investigation must now move to the next phase . Yemeni authorities have been questioning potential witnesses . The `` USS Cole '' will begin its trip home next week .	27
question.v.16	question.v	question	v	Al Gore 's favorability rating is slipping , and for the first time since he emerged as Bill Clinton 's running mate in 1992 , a majority of American adults now view him unfavorably . The latest Gallup Poll , completed Monday , found 52 % of those questioned have an unfavorable view of Gore , compared to 39 % before the election . 46 % have a favorable view of Gore , compared to 56 % before the election .	48
question.v.17	question.v	question	v	President Clinton is questioning the legitimacy of George W. Bush 's election victory . Speaking last night to Democratic supporters in Chicago , the President said Bush won the election only because Republicans stopped the vote - counting in Florida , and Mr. Clinton praised Al Gore 's campaign manager , Bill Daley , for the way he handled the election .	3
question.v.18	question.v	question	v	We 'll be talking with an expert on Saddam Hussein , author Andrew Coburn about whether Saddam Hussein is dead or alive and where in the world is he .

So do we .	72

question.v.23	question.v	question	v	By saying `` another emotional death '' , she reveals that there has been a previous one , although she has not described it in words . This the therapist may pursue in later questioning . The phrase , `` emotional death '' , interesting and , to a non-scientific mind , rather touching , suggests that this woman may have some flair for words , perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably called `` creative '' .	34
question.v.24	question.v	question	v	Society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male -- even the Bible appears to endorse the concept . Family survival on our own Western frontier , for example , could quite literally depend on a man 's strength and ability to bring home the bacon ; ; and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything , including the marriage bed . This carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early 20th centuries , when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring Life With Father manner .	55
question.v.25	question.v	question	v	She later divorced Graham , who is believed to have moved to Bolivia . Houston police got to know Diane two years ago when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring . Last May , they said , she admitted being a prostitute .	31
question.v.26	question.v	question	v	And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot . Most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant 's Department of Jewish Affairs . Counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection .	66
question.v.27	question.v	question	v	They interviewed the conductor of the streetcar Morse said he had taken , but the man did not remember Morse as a passenger . Questioned further , Morse said that there had been four or five priests riding on the same car with him . The conductor did recall having priests as passengers and this satisfied police , although the conductor also pointed out that in heavily Catholic Fall River there were priests riding on almost every trip the streetcar made , so Morse 's statement really proved nothing .	24
question.v.28	question.v	question	v	Yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron saints . When I question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy , I find that they fall into two categories : the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis ; ; and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things do n't count any more in the world of to-day . I am naive , they say , to make use of such words .	18
question.v.29	question.v	question	v	It takes a great deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one 's world simply as a collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern , devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far as they present themselves for inspection . Whitehead is here questioning David Hume 's understanding of the nature of experience ; ; he is questioning , also , every epistemology which stems from Hume 's presupposition that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from causal efficacy , and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world , not directly perceived . What Hume calls `` sensation '' is what Whitehead calls `` perception in the mode of presentational immediacy '' which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy .	67

question.v.31	question.v	question	v	If the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question , it has served as an exclamation . Also , since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer -LRB- and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer -RRB- the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command . However , for convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified according to Table 1 .	24
question.v.32	question.v	question	v	When he was stripped , deloused and numbered by his guards , his much-thumbed sketchbook was seized and thrown on a pile of prisoners ' goods to be confiscated . `` It was then I knew that they were making war against Man , the individual within ! ! -- who questioned things when given orders '' . At Stettin the university-educated artist , who had studied German , was chosen to serve as interpreter and clerk in the office of the Stalag commander .	51
question.v.33	question.v	question	v	Even if people do , in a not far distant future , begin to read one another 's minds , there will still be the question of whether what you find in another man 's mind is especially worth reading -- worth more , that is , than what you can read in good books . Even if men eventually find themselves able to look through walls and around corners , one may question whether this will help them to live better lives . There would be side-conclusions to be drawn , of course ; ; such capacities are impressive evidence pointing to a conception of the human being which does not appear in the accounts of biologists and organic evolutionists ; ; but the basic puzzles of existence would still be puzzling , and we should still have to work out the sort of problems we plan to discuss in this article .	73

question.v.37	question.v	question	v	After she had served the detectives coffee and toast -LRB- they politely declined eggs , uncomfortable about their tenancy -RRB- , she settled down with a morning newspaper and began reading the stock market quotations . While she was thus engaged , McFeeley questioned her about her whereabouts the previous day , any recollections she had of people hanging around , of overcurious delivery boys or repairmen , of strange cars cruising the neighborhood . She answered him precisely , missing not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial reports .	43
question.v.38	question.v	question	v	How foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice . He would have to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory , however it was brought about , would be sweet indeed . His first move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days .	25

question.v.40	question.v	question	v	Her skin crawled : Lolotte had told Maude that she was in the hall and the door was open . Sarah had begun to tell Lucien of Emile , she had begun to question and a little draft had crept across the room from the bedroom door , open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall . So Lolotte -- or anybody -- could have listened , and that somebody could have already been supplied with the missing bottle of opium .	33

question.v.43	question.v	question	v	Even yet there was no realization in his eyes . Ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him . He did not look around .	22
question.v.44	question.v	question	v	A shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again . Behind Ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers . No one seemed to know for sure what had happened , nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver , beyond finding out .	23
question.v.45	question.v	question	v	His voice had not commanded her to stop . It had not questioned why . The women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell ; ; but he might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto him .	12
question.v.46	question.v	question	v	Absolution for his lie ? ? He questioned God 's taking time to telegraph the message , but he felt better about Kizzie , and he took the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole , wondering why he had preserved it .

question.v.49	question.v	question	v	Mills secured Barco 's photograph from the gentleman in charge , rushed to the Hollywood police station to report the theft , and less than five minutes later , detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail of Cal Barco . On their way , they stopped at every gas station along the main boulevards to question the attendants . Finally , at Ye Olde Gasse Filling Station on Avocado Avenue , they learned that their man , having paused to get oil for his car , had asked about the route to San Diego .	58
question.v.50	question.v	question	v	The robe , however , was missing , for by that time Barco had disposed of it at a pawnshop in Glendale . The detectives placed Barco under arrest and , without informing him of the nature of the charge , took him back to Hollywood for questioning . Thus it was that Barco , apprehended for mere larceny , now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered .	47
question.v.51	question.v	question	v	They recall Byron 's classic comment : `` I wish he would explain his explanation '' .

happen.v.5	happen.v	happen	v	Back where he 's run and won 14 times in 24 years , but where this week he 's dead even or maybe even trailing Governor Bush , who is n't in trouble at home , and who just happened to be in Tennessee this week , too , asking his favorite sarcastic question -- `` where exactly is home for the Vice President ? ''	39
happen.v.6	happen.v	happen	v	The incident took place in an area which is under their control , under their security , jurisdiction , and they have to blame themselves . But after tonight 's attack , Israel 's Prime Minister said none of this would have happened if Yasser Arafat had not let known terrorists out of jail . We find no way than to respond like any other free world democracy .	42
happen.v.7	happen.v	happen	v	The new President has to get a State of the Union Message ready and prepare his first budget . All of that has to happen right away .	24
happen.v.8	happen.v	happen	v	It was Justice Breyer who asked the most straightforward question of all . What happens if the court rules in favor of Bush ?	14
happen.v.9	happen.v	happen	v	We 're actually on time today . A rare thing that happens here .	11
happen.v.10	happen.v	happen	v	All the other ports that have been mentioned here that we should have considered as options have had specific threats . So what happened to the FBI warning ? CIA officials say they never received it .	23
happen.v.11	happen.v	happen	v	She says it happens all the time and that she loses money because they do n't have enough coins to make change . The Ecuadorian government has minted coins that resemble US coins in an effort to provide more small change for merchants , but it has taken some time to reach all areas , in small rural communities in the countryside , because not enough dollars have made it into circulation there , but the government and President Gustavo Nobora considers these to be short-term problems and views the overall policy as a grand success .	3
happen.v.12	happen.v	happen	v	She says inflation is now on the decline and bank deposits are increasing . The transition to dollars was eased somewhat by a sharp increase in oil prices in the past year , which allowed oil - producing Ecuador to buy plenty of dollars on the international market , but Maria Delapasvela says now is the time to start thinking about what happens when the situation changes .	62
happen.v.13	happen.v	happen	v	She asks what will happen when oil prices go back down and the country can no longer bring in sufficient dollars to sustain its economy . The Ecuadorian economist says now is the time for the government to implement fiscal reforms and to stimulate competitiveness and diversification in the economy .	4
happen.v.14	happen.v	happen	v	Let 's go to Russia right now Joe , where Vladimir Putin who still remains something of an enigmatic presence in the Russian political scene since he took office at the beginning of the year 2000 , is apparently under siege yet again by revelations that the Russians might possibly have been able to rescue those trapped sailors in the Kursk submarine because some of them evidently survived and it 's apparent that the Russian military suppressed information about what had happened or even distorted it , and was singularly slow in taking up offers of assistance from the Norwegians and the British to help . What impact do you think this new revelation has on Putin 's political stature ?	81
happen.v.15	happen.v	happen	v	Oh , I think it is another step in a diminution of Putin . I think a number of things have happened ; His attempt to restore the image of Russia as a great power has been , I think backfired generally .	21
happen.v.16	happen.v	happen	v	Both sides reported many injured . Against that bloody backdrop , there were diplomatic efforts to call a ceasefire , but after a Washington meeting with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , acting Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said what 's happening is not a civilian uprising as the Palestinians claim , but a military confrontation , a mini war , as he put it . Palestinian negotiator Sayeb Erekat is expected to meet separately with Mrs. Albright and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan , later this week .	42
happen.v.17	happen.v	happen	v	Mr. Ben-Ami said the next step might be separate Washington visits by Israeli and Palestinian leaders . US officials say a three - way summit would happen only if an agreement was in hand . David Gallust , VOA News , the White House .	26
happen.v.18	happen.v	happen	v	Israel 's military commander for the Gaza region Yayir Nave blamed the Palestinian Authority for not cracking down on such attacks . Incidents like this , he says , do not happen without support from inside the Palestinian Authority . Israel has repeatedly called on the Palestinian Authority to curb the violence and take action against those who attack Israelis .	31
happen.v.19	happen.v	happen	v	He says the cause of the Kursk tragedy is known to those in charge . Our Navy commanders they know pretty well and all that 's going on now points that these people want to hide the real thing that had had happened onboard of Kursk . But what did cause the Kursk tragedy ?	42
happen.v.20	happen.v	happen	v	We can not accept what happened today . We can not accept it under any circumstances .	5
happen.v.21	happen.v	happen	v	On Yemeni TV today the country 's President expressed his heart - felt condolences to those who were killed and injured , but denied that the explosion on board the cole was caused by terrorists , although , admits Mohammed Al-Qadhi , editor of the Yemen Observer newspaper in the capital Sana , anti-American sentiment has been running high in Yemen because of events in the Middle East . The people now in the streets are gathering because they feel that not just as Arabs , as human beings , that what is happening in Palestine is not humanitarian . Regarding the United States ' attitude in this regard , we find that the United States until now are supporting Israel .	93
happen.v.22	happen.v	happen	v	He has invested an awful amount in the peace with Israel , and really he can not afford to let it fail . We have seen some more power techniques perhaps from his Foreign Minister Amre Moussa over the last few weeks , but Amre Moussa today at the Foreign Minister 's meeting was calling simply for the return of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians , in stark contrast to Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shara who was pulling for a complete cut in diplomatic relations between Israel and the two Arab states that happen . So Egypt is playing a calming role .	93
happen.v.23	happen.v	happen	v	So what happened here , can you tell me ?	2
happen.v.24	happen.v	happen	v	But the storm has cleared today and from this morning the divers have been down at the bottom of the Barents Sea , working on cutting out this hole in the inner hull of the Kursk . What happens once they do finish ? Do they actually enter the submarine ?	38
happen.v.25	happen.v	happen	v	I think everybody want to stay in his country , want to die in his country . If you can stay and make it happen , the place where you was born , where you grew up then try to make it there . It 's possible .	24
happen.v.26	happen.v	happen	v	You know , in Africa every time you know something bad happens , everybody like you know is because of the white man , you know the colonization , the slavery . They do n't realize that you know the real execution is really black 's black like them .	11
happen.v.27	happen.v	happen	v	They do n't realize that you know the real execution is really black 's black like them . So before they say it is a white man tangle you know it 's because of a white man that this happens and they got to , you know , check around and they say who is the real guilty . We got to accept it and try to , you know , change the things , make the things better .	39
happen.v.28	happen.v	happen	v	Yeah , at the table if it becomes food for instance , which is an option . You are adopting the sheep and whatever happens at the end it 's your choice and among the option is you know food for your meal .	24
happen.v.29	happen.v	happen	v	The biggest democracy in the world and it 's all falling apart . And I say it is because we are a democracy that it 's happening this way . It 's because everybody gets the vote .	26
happen.v.30	happen.v	happen	v	As you start moving down this path towards technical innovation , it invites disruption or it brings about the conflict much quicker than I think most people would be prepared to start dealing with it . I think there is a lot of issues that Japan is starting to question , how do they adapt , how do they change , how do they preserve what is good about their society while making these changes to be more competitive with what 's happening throughout the rest of the world .	82
happen.v.31	happen.v	happen	v	And one of the other main subjects he touched on today , Lisa , was the conflicted southern state of Chiapas . Fox says that his first presidential act will be to send up a proposal to the congress to immediately begin to bring a process of peace back into Chiapas State and that 's something that people really did n't expect to happen so quickly here . All of these issues actually are issues that the United States has been watching very carefully , and US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is there in mexico city for the inaugural .	63
happen.v.32	happen.v	happen	v	Is that correct ? Yes , it has all happened actually very , very quickly . After the court cases dragged on for a couple of months and Pope has been in jail since April the 3rd , the ball really started rolling today .	9
happen.v.33	happen.v	happen	v	If this strikes you as an extraordinary turn of events , well it strikes many overseas as nearly unbelievable . In the democracies of Europe , legal experts are saying it ca n't happen here . Philippe Shatiney is an editor of the French news weekly , Mahiyan .	33
happen.v.34	happen.v	happen	v	Philippe Shatiney is an editor of the French news weekly , Mahiyan . Philippe , could it happen anywhere else .	17
happen.v.35	happen.v	happen	v	I wonder in terms of this particular case , now this is certainly an extreme case in the United States with an unfathomably close election , How have other democracies dealt with effective ties , I mean could there for instance be one of elections , you know where our type has gone to the courts , What happens to yours ?	58
happen.v.36	happen.v	happen	v	Barak 's standing in the polls is so bad that the only thing that can save his political career now is a peace deal , which is the only reason to be optimistic that something might actually happen . It 's that personal self motivation of Barak 's desire to survive politically and to have some kind of future in this country knowing that if he goes to elections with a peace agreement , any kind of peace agreement , he stands much better chance of being elected than going to the electorate with nothing .	37
happen.v.37	happen.v	happen	v	They are just glad to see the back of him . I am not interested about Slobodan Milosevic any more and I do n't really want to know what will happen to him . We must go on .	30
happen.v.38	happen.v	happen	v	Not a whole lot happens in Dornoch , but tomorrow the small Scottish town will be the center of the universe . At least that 's the conclusion you might reach from seeing the hundreds of journalists and photographers camped out there .	4
happen.v.39	happen.v	happen	v	That 's an interesting little anecdote , is n't it ? Well , when this sort of thing happens in a small community and I guess that 's a under statement in this case , whether or not it all succeeds depends on how well some of the local people can keep secrets . Are people kind of , you know , in the fold on this , or are there things being leaked around to press here and there ?	18
happen.v.40	happen.v	happen	v	The World 's Richard Myron is in Tel Aviv now . Richard , describe what 's been happening today . Well , we have had unfortunately what we term a busy day here today , including a suicide bombing in a Jewish settlement in the northern part of the West Bank .	17
happen.v.41	happen.v	happen	v	Well , we have had unfortunately what we term a busy day here today , including a suicide bombing in a Jewish settlement in the northern part of the West Bank . What apparently happened was that a Palestinian went in to a roadside restaurant and he blew himself up critically injuring a number of people . Elsewhere , in the West Bank and Gaza there have been deaths of Palestinians .	34
happen.v.42	happen.v	happen	v	Elsewhere , a number of other Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli forces . So it has been an unfortunately , as I say , busy and bloody day here , and this was happening on the last Friday in Ramadan , which is a very important day for Muslim prayer . Was there any trouble today around the holy sites in Jerusalem ?	35
happen.v.43	happen.v	happen	v	So it has limited the numbers inside , and therefore the amount of trouble , but there was some scuffle and it was expected in a way that there would be certainly tension and a little bit of trouble there today . Of course , all of this is happening against the backdrop of peace talks in Washington , which are in their fourth day today . What about people on the ground there where you are ?	49
happen.v.44	happen.v	happen	v	Are they hopeful something might come out of this ? Are they even paying heed to what is happening in Washington ? I think people are paying heed because I think people realize that there is a sense that it could happen .	18
happen.v.45	happen.v	happen	v	Are they even paying heed to what is happening in Washington ? I think people are paying heed because I think people realize that there is a sense that it could happen . There is a great sense of urgency here .	31
happen.v.46	happen.v	happen	v	They do n't trust the other side . I think they may want the deal to happen , but they do n't trust the intentions of the other side . The Palestinians for their part , I think , are deeply pessimistic .	16
happen.v.47	happen.v	happen	v	I later realized that I was down . I could n't remember what happened thereafter and I found myself in the hospital . Beatrice Ketch was 23 when the bomb ripped out the windows of the office where she worked opposite the embassy .	13
happen.v.48	happen.v	happen	v	Barak 's Foreign Minister Sloma Ben-Ami was in Paris today in an effort to drum up support for a peace deal and increase the left wing leader 's chances in the election . Before rushing back for fresh talks with Palestinian negotiators this evening , Ben-Ami acknowledged that an agreement probably would n't happen before the end of President Clinton 's term later this month and Sharon supporters are castigating Barak for bringing chaos in place of the peace deal he promised . A campaign message for Sharon says , `` Disappointed with Barak , Barak promised , Barak disappointed , Barak must be replaced '' .	53
happen.v.49	happen.v	happen	v	In that moment I felt like it was right up to me to die . I know what 's happening now , but that time I did n't know . I had nine nights , nine days , not eating nor sleeping .	19
happen.v.50	happen.v	happen	v	It gives them a sense of what they have felt for too long now , that politics is just name - callers , increased partisanship , special prosecutors , reliance on lawyers and things that do n't affect the ordinary person , that all that has now mushroomed into something called the Presidency of the United States and how we elect a President . The fact that as we continue on this road and continue to talk about what 's going to happen in Florida , the judges have really already spoken on this , the ultimate judges , the people . Their decision is now being reviewed .	82
happen.v.51	happen.v	happen	v	Israel is usually looking up to the President of the United States for some help . Some Israelis at least , if not most of them , are still hoping that President Clinton might be able to intervene and help in the short time he has left , but the more things are complicated and uncertain back there in the States , I think more and more Israelis are worried that there 's nobody to turn toment -- to , and I think what happened in the past few days among Israelis here is a new perception that maybe things in the United States are not as perfect as they might have thought . Actually , they 're far from being perfect , and they are sounding and looking to us here more and more like what we know from our own political system .	84
happen.v.52	happen.v	happen	v	Well , they have been making this point throughout these proceedings that these ballots have never been counted , and that is factually not true . They have been counted on election night -- they 've been counted in the recounts , and it simply happens to be not -- not the case that those ballots have failed to be counted by anyone .	45
happen.v.53	happen.v	happen	v	Well , I think the number one most important sign is looking at what happened last night , and that is last night at about 7:00 , the public information officer of the court came to us and said we 're going home . We are told , in effect , there wo n't be a ruling tonight .	14
happen.v.54	happen.v	happen	v	We are told , in effect , there wo n't be a ruling tonight . That has n't happened tonight . Now , you know the time is ticking away and yet they are still here .	18
happen.v.55	happen.v	happen	v	It 's violence . It should n't have happened . That 's not democracy .	8
happen.v.56	happen.v	happen	v	A commission set up to ensure the transfer of power is attempting to call lawmakers to Belgrade for a special session . Alessio Vinci reports that may not happen until tomorrow because some members of parliament will have to travel to Belgrade from Montenegro . What is going on right now is intense negotiations with all the members of parliament that were elected on September trying to get the majority needed in order to swear in Vojislav Kostunica as the next President of Yugoslavia .	28
happen.v.57	happen.v	happen	v	There are some votes that apparently were counted wrong . Anyway , it 's unclear exactly what 's happening , but they are contesting some seats . In that case if the two chamber can not agree and meet here , Kostunica until then will not be able to take his hold .	18
happen.v.58	happen.v	happen	v	We can work together , in spite of our political differences , here in this federal parliament . I think the consequences of what has happened will be obvious after a while , but we are a little bit surprised right now , and even now I sometimes think it looks like a dream , but it is a reality , and it is good . Thursday , tens of thousands of people stormed parliament , demanding former President Slobodan Milosevic admit defeat in September 's presidential election and leave office .	25
happen.v.59	happen.v	happen	v	Throughout the afternoon , the security forces have been firing rubber - coated steel bullets , they 've been using concussion grenades and they 've been firing tear gas into the Palestinian crowd , which has been responding with stones and on occasion , fire bombs . What happened on this particular day , a funeral was held for a man who was allegedly beaten to death by Jewish settlers . The Palestinians attended this funeral here in Ramallah and came down to this particular point where there was another confrontation with security forces , one that has occurred numerous times over the past 13 days .	48
happen.v.60	happen.v	happen	v	The U.S. Navy is revising the timeline of last week 's attack on the `` USS Cole . '' It says the explosion happened more than two hours after the ship was tied to a fuel dock , not during the mooring operation , as previously thought . Some wonder then , how the terrorists ' boat could have escaped notice , since there should have been no other boats near the `` Cole . ''	23
happen.v.61	happen.v	happen	v	Putting a little boy through such agony reduces his doctor to tears . Mercifully today this will be the last time it will happen to Ali . Tonight this little boy who has lost so much and been so brave is finally going to --	23
happen.v.62	happen.v	happen	v	Police in Pennsylvania say a student fatally shot a principal before killing himself this morning . It happened in the cafeteria of Red Lion Area Junior High School about 30 miles southeast of Harrisburg . It happened at 7:30 this morning .	17
happen.v.63	happen.v	happen	v	It happened in the cafeteria of Red Lion Area Junior High School about 30 miles southeast of Harrisburg . It happened at 7:30 this morning . Students then were moved across the street to a senior high school .	20
happen.v.64	happen.v	happen	v	Eventually they all find the real mom . No one knows what will happen as the pups grow older and are able to open their eyes . Chances are , they 'll always have a fondness from one hen .	13
happen.v.65	happen.v	happen	v	No one seems to be sure what 's happened to Saddam Hussein and his two sons , but one thing is becoming more clear -- Uday and Qusay were just as bad as their father if not worse . `` Time '' Magazine 's Michael Weisskopf has uncovered some stunning details about the lives of these two .	8
happen.v.66	happen.v	happen	v	I hope this kind of thing can happen in America , instead of it just being these isolated festivals like Bonnaroo , it really can happen in 100 cities every summer , like the festivals do in Europe .	7

All this happening about 90 minutes ago based on the wire reports we 're getting here . The word from Serbia , Zoran Djindjic , the Prime Minister , is dead .	24
happen.v.69	happen.v	happen	v	We happen to be at a very nice spot by the beach where this is a chance for people to get away from CNN coverage , everything , and kind of relax .	1
happen.v.70	happen.v	happen	v	I do n't think it 's affecting our business as much as I was worried that it would , but you never know it 's going to happen . If there 's any kind of terrorism that happens here , I think that would definitely put a damper on everything .	27
happen.v.71	happen.v	happen	v	I do n't think it 's affecting our business as much as I was worried that it would , but you never know it 's going to happen . If there 's any kind of terrorism that happens here , I think that would definitely put a damper on everything .	37

happen.v.74	happen.v	happen	v	You 're looking at the picture of Air Force One taxiing in on the tarmac , getting ready for the President . As we watched this picture of the Air Force One getting into this airport I want to bring in our military analyst General Dan Crisman to go over what happens is happening in Baghdad . Seems pretty far away from Belfast right now , General , but decisions that these two leaders make could have a significant impact on the future of Iraq .	51

First of all , General , we 'll keep this picture up of Air Force One , talk about what you sense is happening on the streets of Baghdad right now .	52

That 's your take on what may have happened in these I understand did n't . The death of this Al Jazeera reporter and these two camera men .	35
happen.v.80	happen.v	happen	v	I think it 's bearing an investigation . First what happened and why they were hit . Secondly the Pentagon has been essentially all over the place .	10

happen.v.83	happen.v	happen	v	Hello , Judy . During a brief phone call with their son from Kuwait on surngd the Army asked the Young family not to get into any specific details about what happened during their son 's capture and release . However , the family did get in a company of questions about how he was treated .	31
happen.v.84	happen.v	happen	v	Now they are learning more details that their son in fact was kicked and beaten after his capture , and that his fellow pilot David Williams had a knife held to his throat immediately after an tur , according to an interview their son was allowed to conduct with `` The Washington Post '' , who flew with him into Kuwait . Their son is said to be in very good spirits now and back here in Georgia , after three weeks of not knowing exactly what had happened to him , finally , for the very first time in three weeks , the Young family members got some sleep last night for the first time in a long time . Well , at least some family members did .	88
happen.v.85	happen.v	happen	v	Reporter : Of course , pictures and videotape and a phone call is one thing , but seeing their son in person is quite another , and they are , of course , hoping that will happen very soon . Young 's mother says , when she sees her son , she plans on hugging him for a good solid half hour .	36
happen.v.86	happen.v	happen	v	We 'll go through all of this throughout the morning here . First , to the Pentagon and Barbara Starr to pick up what 's happening .	25
happen.v.87	happen.v	happen	v	6:03 a.m. Eastern time , seven Americans who had been prisoners of war in Iraq make a public appearance at the medical center in Germany . They say they 're looking forward to going home , which relatives of one former POW say could happen as soon as tomorrow . Officials at the hospital say the seven are in good shape and their prognosis is excellent , even though three have gunshot wounds .	44
happen.v.88	happen.v	happen	v	Good evening , Gregg . What happened ?	6
happen.v.89	happen.v	happen	v	These reunions . That should be happening any moment now . Stay with us .	6
happen.v.90	happen.v	happen	v	Immediately when his boss called to say he had not reported for work , immediately I knew something really , really bad was wrong . It was n't until just a few minutes after 3:00 on Thursday afternoon when the call came back again that they had found him and he was alive and all I could say was Thank God , and from there you all know pretty much what happened .	71
happen.v.91	happen.v	happen	v	Let 's move on to another important story . It 's happened , of course , several times during the war in Iraq , journalists caught in the line of fire and killed . Israeli troops are facing a similar situation with two journalists killed in just the past two weeks .	11
happen.v.92	happen.v	happen	v	James was not shooting and he was not with somebody shooting . So , again , to know exactly what happened we need a full-fledged inquiry .	20
happen.v.93	happen.v	happen	v	She 's accused of beating two of her three children to death because , she says , God told her to . Now that happened this Saturday . Today the wheels of justice began turning .	24
happen.v.94	happen.v	happen	v	That will be a very important development as we continue to watch the Mideast peace process between Palestinians and Israelis develop . We are seeing that Secretary of State Colin Powell also traveling through the region , trying to get regional leaders there to put more pressure on the Palestinians to stop any terrorist activities that may be happening on their behalf as well in that region . We 'll watch and listen very closely to President Khatami 's visit there in Beirut , Lebanon .	58
happen.v.95	happen.v	happen	v	It probably was , indeed , based on your eyewitness accounts . What happened ? They were collecting evidence as you were there , the law enforcement authorities ?	13
happen.v.96	happen.v	happen	v	This news breaking just today . Robert Dallek tried to do the research to track this woman down in the book , it did not happen but now she has indeed come forward .	25
happen.v.97	happen.v	happen	v	We knew it was a matter of time before police got back into the water in San Francisco Bay looking for more evidence in the Laci Peterson case . That happened this morning . Numerous agency R agencies ' boats with sonar technology and divers into San Francisco Bay .	30
happen.v.98	happen.v	happen	v	He wrote Carrot Top is one of those C list celebrities who wormed their way into your consciousness without you knowing how it happened .	23
happen.v.99	happen.v	happen	v	You will hear a P.A. announcement around the entire ship , there is a man overboard so everyone knows they have to react quickly . A ship - wide search will happen if they do n't see that person go overboard , but if indeed they do see someone go overboard , the ship starts to circle that area continuously . Also small boats sometimes go out into the water , but even more importantly , helicopters are launched immediately .	31
happen.v.100	happen.v	happen	v	Also the reason for the 24 - hour search is they fail they 've exhausted all resources by that time . Anyway , we 'll continue to follow what 's happening on the `` USS Nassau '' as those investigations continue for the two missing sailors .	30
happen.v.101	happen.v	happen	v	The consequence of injuring or hurting someone who is friendly or nonparticipant in combat is very difficult to deal with , and we go to extreme details in -- and do a lot of training as well to make sure that does n't happen .	43
happen.v.102	happen.v	happen	v	Can you tell me about the flight five years ago . What happened to you ?	12
happen.v.103	happen.v	happen	v	A convicted murderer is released from prison before serving his full sentence and then a nightmare becomes reality . It happened last week . Michael Sears was determined to prove he was no longer a threat .	20

happen.v.105	happen.v	happen	v	If you find water , you 're very likely to find signs of life .

When I visited your country in 1994 , I recall saying to President Yeltsin that he and I spent most of our lives believing such a visit would never happen , and that I hoped he was as delighted as I was to be proved wrong .

Of course , according to the guardian , she 's very worried about that , too , and she has warned the court that she hopes the mother will be placed in a better home when all of this is over , one where she is far better protected than she was by the state in a home where police say she was raped .	19

happen.v.125	happen.v	happen	v	In a simple ceremony before the newly elected parliament , Vojislav Kostunica took his oath of office late tonight as President of Yugoslavia , marking the end of 13 years of autocratic rule under Slobodan Milosevic . It was a scene few Serbs would have deemed possible only weeks ago , but it almost did n't happen , delayed by Milosevic 's party , which still controls the parliament . After meetings earlier today with a series of foreign dignitaries , Kostunica admitted that Milosevic may be down , but not out .	56

At this point , unfortunately , romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture ; ; but consider , if you can bear it , what might have happened if MacArthur , for some perverse , undaunted reason , had made the same remark to an Eskimo girl in Eskimo . To her peanuts and emeralds would have been just so much blubber .	77
happen.v.128	happen.v	happen	v	I ca n't tell when , but I 'm positive I witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past '' ! ! This experience will have happened to many of you . Emerson , in his lecture , refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room , and heard precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when '' .	32

happen.v.134	happen.v	happen	v	The accumulated information on this point shows that first intercourse , even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty , is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman . Too many new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment . Only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse .	37
happen.v.135	happen.v	happen	v	Smarter than most gamblers , she slipped away from the casino , packed her bag and took the night train to Paris . No one ever learned what happened to the Greek . The luxury of Paris ' most fashionable hotel , the George 5 , , bored the beautifully-built blonde , so she high-tailed it to Rome .	28
happen.v.136	happen.v	happen	v	McClellan , who had once lost his medical license temporarily on a charge of drug addiction , was with her when she died . He had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had happened during that time . When he realized she was dead , he called two lawyers and then the police .	38

happen.v.138	happen.v	happen	v	At any rate , the substance of Eichmann 's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it . If anti-Semitism was on trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann 's Department of Jewish Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as well as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? ?	80
happen.v.139	happen.v	happen	v	Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past . Consider what happened during World War 1 , , when the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition law through Congress . Many of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful .	16

happen.v.141	happen.v	happen	v	On the fateful day in 1896 when the great waves approached Japan , fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells . Not until they sailed home at the end of the day , through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses , were they aware of what had happened . The seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers , drowning thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore .	51
happen.v.142	happen.v	happen	v	The final proof was a small incident . It happened at the St. Patrick 's Day party , a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains of an Irish march . In the middle of the party Chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him , each beaming above the biggest , greenest shamrock he had ever seen .	9

More importantly , he also happens to be the brother-in-law of Sam Rayburn , Speaker of the House . There were aesthetic problems as well as political .	34

Let us look in on one of these nerve centers -- SAC at Omaha -- and see what must still happen before a wing of B-52 bombers could drop their A[fj] . In a word , plenty .	81
happen.v.146	happen.v	happen	v	In addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages , again in special codes , each message also contains an `` internal authenticator '' , another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real thing . I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one . `` I 'd wind up full of bullet holes '' , he said , and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers .	54

happen.v.148	happen.v	happen	v	It is perhaps difficult to conceive , but imagine that tonight on London bridge the Teddy boys of the East End will gather to sing Marlowe , Herrick , Shakespeare , and perhaps some lyrics of their own . That , at any rate , is what happens at the Khaju bridge . Boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade .	47
happen.v.149	happen.v	happen	v	At one side of the stage a dancer jumps excitedly ; ; nearby , another sits motionless , while still another is twirling an umbrella . A man and a girl happen to meet ; ; they look straight at the audience , not at each other . He lifts her , puts her down , and walks off , neither pleased nor disturbed , as if nothing had happened .	31
happen.v.150	happen.v	happen	v	A man and a girl happen to meet ; ; they look straight at the audience , not at each other . He lifts her , puts her down , and walks off , neither pleased nor disturbed , as if nothing had happened .

happen.v.151	happen.v	happen	v	There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears . Lucretius has remarked : `` The reason why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause , and these they attribute to the will of God '' . Perhaps things were even worse then .	50
happen.v.152	happen.v	happen	v	They include both individual fears and collective ones . They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group . Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized .	19
happen.v.153	happen.v	happen	v	America is now joining Europe in this `` mature '' phase of development . Whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going on in the countries of Asia and Africa , and also of course on how long the cold war remains cold .	26
happen.v.154	happen.v	happen	v	But I think that something more than this is involved . How did it happen , for example , that the state university , that great symbol of American democracy , failed to flourish in New England as it did in other parts of the country ? ? Is n't it a bit odd that the three states of Southern New England -LRB- Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode Island -RRB- have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been A & M colleges ? ?	14
happen.v.155	happen.v	happen	v	Finally , in The Maltese Falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion : Sam Spade becomes the chief murder suspect . In order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal , who happens to be his girl friend . What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock Holmes now appears as a direct accusation : the private eye is in danger of turning into his opposite .	46
happen.v.156	happen.v	happen	v	I want to say more about Gabriel 's so-called fundamental law . But first I want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in this country and what happened to it . He points out that from the time of Jackson on through World War 1 , , evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of America .	34
happen.v.157	happen.v	happen	v	But in every period it has been humanism '' . And let me add , utopianism , also . Some fourteen or fifteen years ago , in an essay I called The Leader Follows -- Where ? ? I used his polarity to illustrate what I thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call Progressivism . It seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man .	48
happen.v.158	happen.v	happen	v	The socialism implicit in the slogan of the Roosevelt Revolution , freedom from want and fear , seems a far cry from the individualism of the First Amendment to the Constitution , or of the Jacksonian frontier . What had happened to the common man ? ? French Egalitarianism had had only nominal influence in this country before the days of Popularism .	40
happen.v.159	happen.v	happen	v	All of this , I know , is recent history familiar to you . But I have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common man , to point up what happened to him under Eisenhower 's leadership . A perceptive journalist , Sam Lubell , has phrased it in the title of one of his books as the revolt of the moderates .	36
happen.v.160	happen.v	happen	v	Thus , it is no mystical intuition , but an analyzable conception to say that man and his tradition can `` fall out of existence '' . This happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance in himself , of a nature that , in Maritain 's words , is perceived as a `` locus of intelligible necessities '' . An existentialist is a man who perceives himself only as `` esse '' , as existence without substance .	28
happen.v.161	happen.v	happen	v	Unanalyzed responses anxiety and deep insecurity are the characteristic responses evoked by the crisis in tradition . To experience them , it is not necessary for a people to be actively aware of what is happening to it . The process of erosion need only undermine the tradition and a series of consequences begin unfolding within the individual , while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation of processes occurs .	35
happen.v.162	happen.v	happen	v	And , he added : `` During the many months in prison camp , all abstract images vanished from my mind '' . Before leaving for America , he happened to see his old friend Jean Arp and confided to him his new resolutions . Arp protested : `` But it is impossible ! !	29
happen.v.163	happen.v	happen	v	There would be side-conclusions to be drawn , of course ; ; such capacities are impressive evidence pointing to a conception of the human being which does not appear in the accounts of biologists and organic evolutionists ; ; but the basic puzzles of existence would still be puzzling , and we should still have to work out the sort of problems we plan to discuss in this article . All we want from Dr. Huxley 's statement is the feeling that this is an open world , in the view of the best scientific opinion , with practically no directional commitments as to what may happen next , and no important confinements with respect to what may be possible . It seems quite obvious that all the really difficult tasks of human beings arise from the fact that man is not one , but many .	106
happen.v.164	happen.v	happen	v	The new spirit , so well illustrated by Mr. Lyford 's work , is wholly free of this anxiety . The problem is rather to find out what is actually happening , and this is especially difficult for the reason that `` we are busily being defended from a knowledge of the present , sometimes by the very agencies -- our educational system , our mass media , our statesmen -- on which we have had to rely most heavily for understanding of ourselves '' . The Introduction continues : `` We experience a vague uneasiness about events , a suspicion that our political and economic institutions , like the genie in the bottle , have escaped confinement and that we have lost the power to recall them .	30
happen.v.165	happen.v	happen	v	Of one thing we can be sure : they were not sketched out by the revolutionary theorists of the eighteenth century who formulated the political principles and originally shaped the political institutions of what we term the `` free society '' . No doubt there are historians who can explain to a great extent what happened to the plans and projects of the eighteenth century . Going back over this ground and analyzing the composition of forces which have created the present scene is one of the tasks undertaken by the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions , in Santa Barbara .	55
happen.v.166	happen.v	happen	v	It must be granted that the flouting of convention , no matter how well intentioned one may be , is sure to lead to trouble , or at least to the discomfort that goes with social disapproval . Even so , many of the things that happened to Wright and Olgivanna seem inordinately severe . Their afflictions centered on one maddening difficulty : Miriam held up the divorce proceedings that she herself had asked for .	46
happen.v.167	happen.v	happen	v	She read everything else she could get her hands on , including an article -LRB- she thinks it was in the Atlantic Monthly -RRB- by Mark Twain on `` White Slavery '' .

happen.v.168	happen.v	happen	v	His hands lay loosely , yet stiffly -- they were like wax hands : almost lifelike , not quite -- folded in his lap ; ; his mouth hung slightly open . When he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was inescapable , he would answer ; ; if , as often happened , he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly , he would repeat his words in the same way , without emphasis or impatience , only a little louder . He had not mentioned Kate .	59
happen.v.169	happen.v	happen	v	He was n't troubled with the ordinary , rank-and-file fear that overcomes and paralyzes and sends individual soldiers and whole companies under fire running in panic . It just did n't occur to Trig that anything serious would happen to him . Do you get the picture of the kind of fellow he was '' ? ?	38
happen.v.170	happen.v	happen	v	This is why I say we just ca n't go ahead and disarm the Germans and pull down our own defenses . Let me tell you what happened to me today . A fellow came up to me , a Senator , I do n't have to tell you his name , and he told me , ' I love the President like a brother , but God damn it , he 's crucifying me .	27

It was my initiation to war and the insane symphony war plays ; ; for what had happened on the common was only terror and flight ; ; but this grinning , broken head , not ten feet away from me , was the sharp definition of what my reality had become .

Along Wappinger Creek in Dutchess County , past the white church at Fishkill , past Verplanck 's Point on the east bank of the Hudson , to the white salt-crusted roads of the Long Island Rockaways there was a watching and an activity of preparing for something explosive to happen .

I mean we know the order in which things happen , but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days or to make calendars and there 's not much climate here , so none of us know how long anything takes .

happen.v.230	happen.v	happen	v	In any case , he had no intention of being caught asleep , so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he took his Winchester with him and leaned it against the fence . He stopped every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon , but nothing happened , each day dragging out with monotonous calm . When , in late afternoon on the last day in June , he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house , he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle .	56

As I dug in behind one of the bales we were using as protection , I grudgingly found myself agreeing with Oso 's logic , especially when I imagined what would have happened to Missy if Old Knife 's large party of screeching warriors had overrun our company . For , unlike the Sioux and the Crows , the Aricaras are not great horsemen , nor are they aggressive like the savage Blackfeet .	50
happen.v.235	happen.v	happen	v	She wished that she could talk to her mother about it . Not that her mother knew what had happened , but they could speculate upon it . But her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it , and say that it was none of her concern .	19

happen.v.242	happen.v	happen	v	But even a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day . Nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle , tended the cattle , tethered the horses , gathered fuel , carried water , and started their cooking fires . Then , and only then , with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests of honor , did the Harrows take time to catch up on the news .	32
happen.v.243	happen.v	happen	v	`` Do n't reckon there 's nobody out there , 'cept maybe Dan , who can outgrip me , Harmony '' . With Rod on his way and Matilda visiting with Mrs. Jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff , Harmony settled on the edge of the grub box , to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs , and worried about all that might have happened to Sally . And she was deeply thankful that she could see her now , out there in the midst of a gay , youthful circle , skipping and singing , `` Farmer in the dell , Farmer in the dell , Heigh-ho the dairy-oh , the farmer in the dell '' .	76
happen.v.244	happen.v	happen	v	I said , `` Do we know each other , Miss '' ? ? `` No , I remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here , and when it happened all I could think of was '' -- This time she stopped the rush of words herself .	34
happen.v.245	happen.v	happen	v	She set the dipper on the edge of the deck , leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully . `` What happens when there 's no more water '' ? ? She asked smolderingly . She was like charcoal , he thought -- dark , opaque , explosive .	27
happen.v.246	happen.v	happen	v	He did not look around . `` What happened '' ? ? Someone said . `` He 's hurt '' ! ! A woman 's voice said , and then he heard a sort of wail from the man 's wife .	8
happen.v.247	happen.v	happen	v	Behind Ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers . No one seemed to know for sure what had happened , nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver , beyond finding out . Ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman .	18
happen.v.248	happen.v	happen	v	`` When I came up , damnit , I thought I was going down . I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening '' . `` Pressure-happy '' , Artie said , and climbed in .	26

happen.v.250	happen.v	happen	v	Not right away '' . He had his voice under control again : no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him . Waddell , the newspaperman , was a fellow in his middle forties , with a graying crewcut , heavy-framed glasses , and a large jaw padded with fat .	25
happen.v.251	happen.v	happen	v	Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge . He was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the German , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley . `` Hi there , Schaffner '' , he had said .	22
happen.v.252	happen.v	happen	v	But youth asked nothing of its parents -- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing . The only thing unusual about the Old Man had long since happened . But the past was dead here as the present was dead .	32

happen.v.255	happen.v	happen	v	She looked around , self-consciously . Four little Japanese waitresses were murdering the English language at the counter -- Yuki Kobayashi happened to be one of them . Everybody but Tommy seemed to think it was charming when they called , `` Bifutek-san '' ! ! For a steak sandwich , or `` Kohi Futotsu '' ! ! For one cup of coffee .	21
happen.v.256	happen.v	happen	v	Owen wanted to be pleasant because Buzz worked the territory next to his , but he had n't come to Reno for stag dinners . `` Thanks '' , Owen said , `` but Friday is a long way off and anything can happen '' . Buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his victims rest .	43

happen.v.258	happen.v	happen	v	But now the dream was over . The big waking up had happened . `` What did I imagine '' ? ? She thought .	12
happen.v.259	happen.v	happen	v	Like Mattie and the mayor up there gripping the microphone and Toonker Burkette back in his office yanking out teeth , like they all knew he would . Just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen . Or you could hope the parachute would n't open just so you could say you saw it not open , not because you meant any harm to Starkey Poe in his suit of red underwear , but mainly because you were tired of being an old maid -- a thing which can not admit when it thinks it might be pregnant , but must stand the dizzy feeling all alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice : `` I think I 'm pregnant '' .	60
happen.v.260	happen.v	happen	v	Or you could wish your daddy would really do it -- kill Gratt Shafer like he said when you all the time , all along , could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night . So you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights , waiting for you , for your new spectator pumps , waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt , crying and afraid and trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch tire off , because that is being an old maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it is changing the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , hating to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help . And every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you wo n't tell , a combination like ham and eggs , rape her and kill her , and that is being an old maid too .	133
happen.v.261	happen.v	happen	v	She was found the day after at the bottom of the cliff . I tried to believe that what must have happened was that , restless , disturbed by this telephone call or whatever , she walked out in the night , as she had a habit of doing . Sometimes she took the path that winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff .	21
happen.v.262	happen.v	happen	v	I could tell them , but no one ever asked , why I had cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body . No , I forget Mrs. Mathias , who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened . She haunted me ; ; she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised Mrs. Salter to return to the country .	42
happen.v.263	happen.v	happen	v	I will be the one to confront my daughter , not the wife of him who leads her to sin '' ! ! She retreated before the naked shame in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her lodge where Walitzee stirred , mumbling , sitting up in a half stupor to say : `` What worrisome thing happens ? ? I thought I dreamed of wolves fighting '' .	65

Every piece of the nightmare was clear , in place ; ; and when he woke up , his father was saying , `` Stop screaming , Quint .	10

happen.v.270	happen.v	happen	v	It was the kind of thing that could ruin a man 's life , and it was a tribute to John 's strength of character and very real business ability that it had n't ruined his . `` Of course , there was nothing you could do , but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen '' , Mousie Chandler said to Linda Stuart . `` Poor John '' ! !	60
happen.v.271	happen.v	happen	v	They had their first real fight , and Bobbie went off to get drunk . Linda dragooned her uncle , Donald Murkland , into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened . He was a director of S. & M. and must have been in on the decision .	34
happen.v.272	happen.v	happen	v	Chris was sound asleep , and I did n't see any sense in waking him . I dressed in the kitchen , then left a note on the table telling him what had happened . I drove off through the cool darkness to Nadine 's apartment and rang the bell , and in a few seconds a young girl opened the door .	33
happen.v.273	happen.v	happen	v	Pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on Seven -- he 'd had a case of post-operative shock , but it was all taken care of now . Seven is a women 's floor and , as it happened , not very busy right then . When we 'd finished our regular rounds , Pete pointed me toward the small ward at the end of the floor .	43
happen.v.274	happen.v	happen	v	But if she was n't interested , she 'd just go back to the same life she 'd left . Turning toward the patient again , I -- I ca n't describe what happened to me then , except to say that I felt sick . I tell you , it took every ounce of control I had to be able to speak .	33
happen.v.275	happen.v	happen	v	I knew all about her . She was another human being and happened to be a hustler . I did n't much care if she were there or not .	12
happen.v.276	happen.v	happen	v	`` Drop a cold key down his back '' . `` I just hope this happens to you someday '' , said Cousin Elec , who was not at his best . `` Poor Cousin Elec '' , George said .	15
happen.v.277	happen.v	happen	v	Of course , it was n't Anne and George 's fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another , and were n't they always emphasizing that they really did n't know what they would do without Theresa ? ? The trouble is , Theresa thought , that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter supremely , nothing here is supposed even to exist . They would not care if all of Europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow .	51
happen.v.278	happen.v	happen	v	He apologized so sweetly , I could n't keep being annoyed with him '' . It was n't even true that he 'd said he was sorry that time ; ; he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing had n't happened , which was as honest as he could put it . But his mother told the story over and over , till her `` Martin said he was sorry '' was as much a part of her as the shape of her thin , pallid ears .	44
happen.v.279	happen.v	happen	v	Naturally , Viola had no wish to remain , but she felt she could n't leave so soon after her arrival , in all politeness to her host . And it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds ; ; while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which , as Fate would have it , belonged to District Attorney Welch . As Viola sat there , a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes and socks from the unidentified feet and , as a prank , insert rosebuds between the toes .	32
happen.v.280	happen.v	happen	v	The policeman walked on , but he looked back once . that had happened on the day when two other unusual things had occurred . Arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; ; and they had told their mother about the tumbles .	13

happen.v.282	happen.v	happen	v	The innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of lemon-meringue pie , gets a plate of English muffins instead . Leaving the theatre after the performance , I had a flash of intuition that life , after all -LRB- as Rilke said -RRB- , is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the American theatre since Brooks Atkinson retired . Aging but still precocious , French feline enfant terrible Francoisette Lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old Paris again , this time with a sexy ballet scenario called The Lascivious Interlude , the story of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls hopelessly in love with a middle-aged steam shovel .	89

happen.v.340	happen.v	happen	v	[Senator_Schumer] I would have hoped that the President would choose a real consensus nominee who would have much broader support /.

[Senator_Schumer] Sam may have been on the edge /.	26
happen.v.341	happen.v	happen	v	[Senator_Schumer] And you know I got to tell you this Larry /. [Senator_Schumer] I ca n't tell you what will happen with Judge Alito /. [Senator_Schumer] I think it 's very close as David Gergen said /.	20

happen.v.345	happen.v	happen	v	[General_Abizaid] that 's to drive us out before the Iraqis are ready to assume the battle space /. [General_Abizaid] If that 's what happens they could win /. [General_Abizaid] But but it 's very very clear to me that we 're going to stay the course , that we 're going to build Iraqi security capacity , that the Iraqi are serious about being partners in this effort and they 're very serious about taking over the effort /.	23
happen.v.346	happen.v	happen	v	[General_Abizaid] but ultimately we did /. [General_Abizaid] And that 's what 's going to happen with the Iraqi armed forces as well /. [General_Abizaid] They need time /.	14
happen.v.347	happen.v	happen	v	[General_Abizaid] It brings foreign fighters in from Saudi Arabia and North Africa /. [General_Abizaid] It is connected to what is happening in Afghanistan and what is happening in Pakistan /. [General_Abizaid] It is a global battle that we face /.	20

happen.v.350	happen.v	happen	v	[Wolf_Blitzer] That 's a disturbing element I assume for you as far as the demoralization of the ~US military /. [General_Abizaid] That the only thing I can tell you Wolf is when I go to the field the soldiers are uniformly confident about their ability to face this enemy make Iraq Afghanistan whatever area they happen to be operating in better defeat the terrorist wherever they find them and they all understand it 's going to take time /. [General_Abizaid] It it it 's not a sprint /.	55
happen.v.351	happen.v	happen	v	[Carl_Levin] but I do n't think so /. [Carl_Levin] I think that the problem here that we 've had right from the beginning is overly optimistic predictions on the part of what would happen if we attacked Iraq /. [Carl_Levin] And it 's these policies which need to be changed /.	33
happen.v.352	happen.v	happen	v	[President_Emile_Lahoud] For sure it 's not Lebanon nor Syria [President_Emile_Lahoud] because until the assassination everything was fine , the stability and security were at its best according to Interpol who are number one on the list of security in the world /. [President_Emile_Lahoud] And what happened made us uh go back because we lost a lot by it and I 'm sure that nobody harms himself /. [President_Emile_Lahoud] So it could n't be Syria nor Lebanon /.	45
happen.v.353	happen.v	happen	v	[President_Emile_Lahoud] We said because they were trying to unstable Lebanon /.

happen.v.354	happen.v	happen	v	[Jon_Kyl] If we have a profile of some kind of killer in this society and frankly there 's {a} rapist on the loose in Arizona right now and there is a a picture that 's been drawn of by by police uh artists of what this guy looks like . [Jon_Kyl] And anybody that has an appearance somewhat like him should expect to be profiled by the police here /. [Jon_Kyl] By the way he happens to be a young white male apparently /. [Jon_Kyl] But whatever the appearance of a potential terrorist is is fair game for profiling /.	75
happen.v.355	happen.v	happen	v	[Wayne_Hale] That is the problem that we have to solve for the next flight /. [Wayne_Hale] For this flight we are -- we understand what happened in terms of damage to the orbiter /. [Wayne_Hale] And we believe it will be safe to re-enter /.	25
happen.v.356	happen.v	happen	v	[Wayne_Hale] We have provisions to bring back the entire seven person crew of Discovery if required in an emergency situation /.

happen.v.357	happen.v	happen	v	[Wayne_Hale] we 've built the recumbant seats [Wayne_Hale] um and the other emergency provisions to bring back that larger crew on a single rescue flight if required /. [Wolf_Blitzer] How did this miscalculation happen /? [Wayne_Hale] You know we looked very hard at the foam on the pal ramp before flight /.	33
happen.v.358	happen.v	happen	v	[Wolf_Blitzer] but a quick question /. [Wolf_Blitzer] When do you believe if it happens the next shuttle will take off /? [Wayne_Hale] Well we are -- we are putting together a team that will go off and do an investigation uh and come up with the solution on this problem /.	13
happen.v.359	happen.v	happen	v	[Bob_Woodward] Sure a little bit /. [Bob_Woodward] but you know what what happened ah /. [Bob_Woodward] There were so many specifics in our stories ah about money and and high level people in the White house and the Nixon campaign that the prosecutors could subpoena them and get them to talk which eventually they did /.	12
happen.v.360	happen.v	happen	v	[Bob_Woodward] I 've got other things to do /. [Bob_Woodward] ah I know what happened /. [Bob_Woodward] he kn- he knows ah what happened /.	14

happen.v.362	happen.v	happen	v	[Bob_Woodward] who knows ah /. [Bob_Woodward] Funny things happen /. [Bob_Woodward] but I think ah Felt 's lawyer and family can do ah something that 's going to add to the record on all of this /.	8
happen.v.363	happen.v	happen	v	[Howard_Kurtz] but that her former boss says no way /. [Howard_Kurtz] that never happened /. [Howard_Kurtz] And the Times was so conflicted in covering the controversy the editors killed the story about Libby and pulled their punches in other ways /.	13

happen.v.365	happen.v	happen	v	[Arianna_Huffington] And the similarities for the Jayson Blair case /. [Arianna_Huffington] Remember after the Jayson Blair scandal broke we had a seven thousand word story that did not give a full account of what happened . [Arianna_Huffington] Especially about why is a major institution like the Times ignoring so many red flags /. [Howard_Kurtz] Alright /.	34
happen.v.366	happen.v	happen	v	[Arianna_Huffington] The truth is that it 's very clear from the stories today that she could 've asked uh Scooter Libby to call her so that she could hear the timber of his voice earlier /. [Arianna_Huffington] All of that could have happened /. [Arianna_Huffington] It did not happen because clearly Judy Miller is protecting another source that she still has not revealed to the American public /.	42
happen.v.367	happen.v	happen	v	[Arianna_Huffington] All of that could have happened /. [Arianna_Huffington] It did not happen because clearly Judy Miller is protecting another source that she still has not revealed to the American public /. [Arianna_Huffington] And the New York Times is /.	12
happen.v.368	happen.v	happen	v	[Frank_Sesno] You 're going to walk through it /. [Frank_Sesno] so that it happened does n't surprise me /. [Frank_Sesno] That it hurts the President yeah that 's inevitable too /.	13

happen.v.370	happen.v	happen	v	[Tom_Friedman] but there 's only {one?} way we win this war Howie is it takes a village /. [Tom_Friedman] It only happens when the Sunni Muslim world basically turns people in [Tom_Friedman] and when the Sunni Muslim world restrains their own /. [Tom_Friedman] And what was so shocking to me about this story a Sunni Jihadi suicide bomber blows up a mosque number one on the first day of Ramadan /.	21
happen.v.371	happen.v	happen	v	[Tom_Friedman] And there 's so much fatigue that we do n't sit back and say wait a minute /. [Tom_Friedman] what happened today /? [Tom_Friedman] A Sunni Muslim fundamentalist went into a mosque on the first day of Ramadan their holiest day /.	21
happen.v.372	happen.v	happen	v	[Tom_Friedman] but at the end of the day the Bush administration made a very big claim um that it could go to Iraq um and produce a decent forward looking government there /. [Tom_Friedman] If that happens then I think President Bush is going to have a a very huge quiver you know in his uh legacy there /. [Tom_Friedman] Um if it -- if it does n't happen I think uh the administration will be seen as a complete and utter failure /.	36
happen.v.373	happen.v	happen	v	[Tom_Friedman] If that happens then I think President Bush is going to have a a very huge quiver you know in his uh legacy there /. [Tom_Friedman] Um if it -- if it does n't happen I think uh the administration will be seen as a complete and utter failure /.

happen.v.374	happen.v	happen	v	[Howard_Kurtz] That 's a -- uh that 's a harsh uh assessment /. [Tom_Friedman] I would say that there was a lot of ignoring -- there 's several things happened basically in the last three years /. [Tom_Friedman] I would call it a poli- -- a perfect storm /.	29

happen.v.382	happen.v	happen	v	[Wu_huixuan] For instance , the US attacked al-Jazeera TV station several times . [Wu_huixuan] It happened once that when Bush , er , together with that Defense Secretary Rumsfeld visited Qatar , they put pressure , put pressure on the Qatari government , saying you should not broadcast these news items that were harmful to the US . [Wang_shilin] Uh-huh .	15
happen.v.383	happen.v	happen	v	[speaker#1] While the US military searched everywhere for information on bin Laden in vain , al-Jazeera TV station frequently aired the footage of bin Laden making a speech .

happen.v.384	happen.v	happen	v	[Wang_shilin] Yeah . [Ruan_zongze] In addition , it also looks at major events as they happen from the unique perspective of the Arab region or Arab world . [Wang_shilin] Uh-huh .	15

happen.v.386	happen.v	happen	v	[Wang_shilin] Welcome to Focus Today . [Wang_shilin] Today , let 's turn our attention to a road cave-in accident that happened in Beijing over the holiday . [Wang_shilin] Before dawn on January 3 , a sewage pipe leakage accident occurred at the main and side roads of Jingguang Bridge , East Third Ring Road , Beijing Municipality , resulting in the road caving in .	20
happen.v.387	happen.v	happen	v	[Wang_shilin] Well , I especially want to know , ha , how the two of you found out the news on the day of the accident ? [Zhou_hanhua] Ah , at 11:00 a.m. , about 11:00 m. yesterday , ah , I happened to find out through an SMS when I was outside . [Wang_shilin] Uh-huh .	42
happen.v.388	happen.v	happen	v	[Wang_shilin] Uh-huh . [Zhou_hanhua] It happened that I was going to have lunch with a friend , um , at noon . [Zhou_hanhua] And then , the friend first sent me an SMS , [Wang_shilin] Uh-huh . [Zhou_hanhua] saying he would come pick me up to go together .	5
happen.v.389	happen.v	happen	v	[Wang_shilin] And you , Yang Yang ? [Yang_yang] A friend happened to call me . [Wang_shilin] You were not at work that day ?	10
happen.v.390	happen.v	happen	v	[Yang_yang] No . [Yang_yang] The station called me at noon and said something happened at Jingguang Bridge and that I had to go to the station immediately to research the upcoming program . [Wang_shilin] Uh-huh , that means , er , you found out the accident through an information source at the station .	13
happen.v.391	happen.v	happen	v	[Wang_shilin] We drive often in Beijing , ha , Yang Yang . [Wang_shilin] If people were not informed of such a traffic accident through SMS on that day and they continued to head there , what do you think would happen if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear ? [Yang_yang] Yes .	40
happen.v.392	happen.v	happen	v	[Yang_yang] Well , I think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes . [Wang_shilin] If the accident did not happen , perhaps everyone would not know that this place could normally have so many -- [Yang_yang] It is really like this , just look at the bus signs .	31
happen.v.393	happen.v	happen	v	[Wang_shilin] You , through your listeners , what kind of feedback did you find out from them ? [Yang_yang] Actually , this morning , some listeners , ah , also happened to tell us about it via mobile phone SMS . [Yang_yang] Many of their friends -- Since we know that Jingguang Bridge is located in the CBD district , well there are many office buildings , ah , a lot of them , as well as quite a lot of friends who get up early in the morning to go to work .	30
happen.v.394	happen.v	happen	v	[Zhou_hanhua] Yes . [Zhou_hanhua] Yes , I think through a few incidents that happened in Beijing Municipality over recent years , such as SARS , the snowfall a few years ago , the heavy rains two years ago , and the road cave-in at East Third Ring Road this time , I think it can be seen that Beijing Municipality 's response capabilities continued to improve each time . [Wang_shilin] Right .	13
happen.v.395	happen.v	happen	v	[Yang_yang] Beijing Municipality still had no emergency plan . [Yang_yang] Well , at that time , it happened that I was hosting the Unblocked All the Way program in the studio that evening . [Wang_shilin] Well , at that time , traffic was not at all unblocked .	17
happen.v.396	happen.v	happen	v	[Michelle_Kosinski] Well it turns out he was just afraid for his identity to be known /. [Michelle_Kosinski] but we learned that he came forward very quickly after he says he saw what happened in the landfill that day just days after it happened /. [Michelle_Kosinski] He talked to police /.	32
happen.v.397	happen.v	happen	v	[Michelle_Kosinski] Well it turns out he was just afraid for his identity to be known /. [Michelle_Kosinski] but we learned that he came forward very quickly after he says he saw what happened in the landfill that day just days after it happened /. [Michelle_Kosinski] He talked to police /.	32
happen.v.398	happen.v	happen	v	[Beth_Holloway_Twitty] A beautiful eighteen year old blonde-headed girl from New Jersey and um you know was able to recount an encounter that she had with Joran Van Der Sloot Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe during the month of April oh five /. [Dan_Abrams] And what did she say happened /? [Beth_Holloway_Twitty] We- you know it 's a pretty long scenario /.	48
happen.v.399	happen.v	happen	v	[T.J._Ward] Well again we do n't think there was a violent issue with with him with Natalee /. [T.J._Ward] We think probably +something has happened to Natalee /. [T.J._Ward] and they panicked and and then went forth and did what they were supposed to do /.	24
happen.v.400	happen.v	happen	v	[T.J._Ward] I mean there there 's issues of that 's come up /. [T.J._Ward] Um we kn- -- we know that there 's in -- um well w- we we feel something happened when Na- -- when Natalee was with them /. [Dan_Abrams] What do you mean by that /?	32
happen.v.401	happen.v	happen	v	[T.J._Ward] Either she either passed out regurgitated /. [T.J._Ward] um something had happened /. [T.J._Ward] And on top of that now there 's a statement that 's come up from Joran Van Der Sloot that 's he 's given to the police uh one of twenty-two statements he 's given by the way that um Deepak had uh killed her on raped her and killed her on the beach /.	12
happen.v.402	happen.v	happen	v	[Harvey_Levin] I I 'm telling you Dan you and I have covered a lot of trials in this city /. [Harvey_Levin] and we 've seen a lot of weird things happen since ~OJ Simpson with books and everything else /. [Harvey_Levin] If jurors realize that there 's -- tha- that there 's a back end if you will which is a Hollywood term to these trials and if they get caught so what they get caught but they can still publish a book [Harvey_Levin] if they believe that everything is going to change in this city /.	30
happen.v.403	happen.v	happen	v	[Dan_Abrams] appreciate it /. [Dan_Abrams] Coming up no clear explanation for what happened to a honeymooner who disappeared from a Mediterranean cruise last month /. [Dan_Abrams] Police now focusing on three men seem to be telling some inconsistent stories /.	12
happen.v.404	happen.v	happen	v	[Milissa_Rehberger] Hello I 'm Milissa Rehberger /. [Milissa_Rehberger] Here 's what 's happening /. [Milissa_Rehberger] The Russian military is racing to rescue seven sailors trapped in a minisubmarine six hundred and twenty-five feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean /.	12
happen.v.405	happen.v	happen	v	[Susan_Filan] That 's law enforcement 's focus /. [Susan_Filan] If this young man will talk this could break open what happened to George /. [Susan_Filan] The key question is is this a tragic accident or is this foul play /?	20
happen.v.406	happen.v	happen	v	[Dan_Abrams] ~US attorney Kevin O'Connor said we have reason to believe there could have been foul play here /. [Dan_Abrams] Um alright uh Mister Zalisko do you know anything from your personal experience of having been on the cruise as to what happened /? [Walter_Zalisko] Uh good evening sir /.	42
happen.v.407	happen.v	happen	v	[Larry_Kobilinsky] and I think good policework would connect the individuals in question with the casino with Mister Smith /. [Larry_Kobilinsky] and that might help us understand what happened /. [Dan_Abrams] Excuse this is um a little bit more sound /.	27
happen.v.408	happen.v	happen	v	[Dan_Abrams] I mean even when I was down there I saw the kinds of hours uh that people were working etcetera /. [Dan_Abrams] and I know that there was a -- the goal was to give a lot of people some time off uh right after this happened in order to allow them to to get their wits back to be able to relax a little bit /. [Dan_Abrams] But you know you look at this guy you know punching the the one guy grabbing the ~AP producer you know /.	47
happen.v.409	happen.v	happen	v	[Dan_Abrams] Uh actually first let me go to Joe Tackapena on that /. [Dan_Abrams] Joe is that a legal defense meaning could these guys come into court and say we were so traumatized by everything that happened that it eventually led to this /? [Joe_Tackapena] Yes Dan quite frankly it is /.	36
happen.v.410	happen.v	happen	v	[Eddie_Jordan_Jr.] And the citizens are are not going to tolerate uh police officers engaging in brutality uh because of the uh extraordinary circumstances that we have going on today /. [Dan_Abrams] Victoria Habathee if you were asked to testify in some sort of be proceeding be it a pre-trial hearing be it a trial be it to to provide uh general thoughts on on the psychological condi- conditions of some of these officers [Dan_Abrams] knowing what you know about what happened in New Orleans , is it fair for some of them to say everything that happened the amount of hours we were working the fact that we 've been away from our families etcetera from the psychological point of view does that explain what we see on the video tape /? [Victoria_Habathee] I ca n't justify what 's on the video tape /.	80
happen.v.411	happen.v	happen	v	[Eddie_Jordan_Jr.] And the citizens are are not going to tolerate uh police officers engaging in brutality uh because of the uh extraordinary circumstances that we have going on today /. [Dan_Abrams] Victoria Habathee if you were asked to testify in some sort of be proceeding be it a pre-trial hearing be it a trial be it to to provide uh general thoughts on on the psychological condi- conditions of some of these officers [Dan_Abrams] knowing what you know about what happened in New Orleans , is it fair for some of them to say everything that happened the amount of hours we were working the fact that we 've been away from our families etcetera from the psychological point of view does that explain what we see on the video tape /? [Victoria_Habathee] I ca n't justify what 's on the video tape /.	80
happen.v.412	happen.v	happen	v	[Joe_Tackapena] And and that 's exac- Dan exactly right /. [Joe_Tackapena] Look it does n't justify what happened /. [Joe_Tackapena] but I think you need to sit down with the client /.	17
happen.v.413	happen.v	happen	v	[Matt_Biehl] Uh I had met Ben Folly in February uh of this year when I took Taylor down to look at ~VCU as a possible school that she might want to attend /. [Dan_Abrams] And uh what what happened at that meeting /? [Matt_Biehl] Well I was dropping Taylor off /.	38
happen.v.414	happen.v	happen	v	[Matt_Biehl] Um it was i- i- -- it was closing that /. [Matt_Biehl] at least we knew where she was and what had happened to her to some extent /. [Matt_Biehl] that she was not there was a reason for her not calling us /.	23
happen.v.415	happen.v	happen	v	[Bill_Fitzgerald] Hello I 'm Bill Fitzgerald /. [Bill_Fitzgerald] and here 's what 's happening /. [Bill_Fitzgerald] Amid the devastation after Saturday 's powerful earthquake in Pakistan some dramatic rescues /.	13
happen.v.416	happen.v	happen	v	[Jay_Sekulow] They could ask him to come in through a subpoena /. [Jay_Sekulow] They can also which will probably happen through the investigative process that 's probably under way as we speak Dan find out about the this information /. [Jay_Sekulow] But let me tell you something /.	19
happen.v.417	happen.v	happen	v	[Elliot_Minkford] That means even more important than Dobson or Rove testifying is her testifying in a straightforwrad way what both Republicans and Democrats want to know /. [Dan_Abrams] But that 's -- look that 's not going to happen all right /. [Dan_Abrams] Look it 's not -- it 's -- that 's just -- all right tha- that 's -- all right but that 's a nice theory /.	38
happen.v.418	happen.v	happen	v	[Dan_Abrams] Look it 's not -- it 's -- that 's just -- all right tha- that 's -- all right but that 's a nice theory /. [Dan_Abrams] it 's not going to happen /. [Dan_Abrams] I can -- I can promise you that /.	34
happen.v.419	happen.v	happen	v	[Dan_Abrams] I promise you she will not answer the questions that you want answered /. [Dan_Abrams] I mean it wo n't happen /. [Elliot_Minkford] If you 're right about that , if you 're right about that /.	21
happen.v.420	happen.v	happen	v	[Elliot_Minkford] I would n't b- -- I would n't be surprised for the first time to see Republican and Democratic senators unite and say we need to know more about the nominee /. [Dan_Abrams] That may -- look tha- that may ha- -- th- that may happen /. [Dan_Abrams] but anyone who 's now claiming that they expect to get the answers from Miers in the confirmation hearing , that 's going to somehow uh assure them one way or the other are just grandstanding because they know they 're not going to get it /.	46
happen.v.421	happen.v	happen	v	[Russell_Vancamp] But when it shocks the conscience of the average person /. [Russell_Vancamp] and any any normal human bead would be -- human being would be shocked by what happened here and how easy it would have been for uh the uh responsible authorities to look back at a twenty five year history of this devil incarnate and uh not let him loose /. [Russell_Vancamp] and this situation would not have happened /.	29
happen.v.422	happen.v	happen	v	[Russell_Vancamp] and any any normal human bead would be -- human being would be shocked by what happened here and how easy it would have been for uh the uh responsible authorities to look back at a twenty five year history of this devil incarnate and uh not let him loose /. [Russell_Vancamp] and this situation would not have happened /. [Russell_Vancamp] The family wants to stop this for the future /.	59
happen.v.423	happen.v	happen	v	[Russell_Vancamp] that 's what they want to do /. [Dan_Abrams] Is there a danger that if if lawsuits like this succeed that that basically any time a uh public official does something uh acts in a particular way or does n't act that if something horrible happens later that person will be held civily responsible /? [Russell_Vancamp] Well in this type of case especially now /-	46
happen.v.424	happen.v	happen	v	[Russell_Vancamp] and through their neglegence uh we lost human lives /. [Russell_Vancamp] and then horrendous things happened to little kids /. [Russell_Vancamp] and uh th- this is the kind of case that 's an exception to that kind of generalization that you talk about /.	16
happen.v.425	happen.v	happen	v	[Russell_Vancamp] and uh th- this is the kind of case that 's an exception to that kind of generalization that you talk about /. [Dan_Abrams] An- and you think it 's fair then to say that y- you blame the Minnesota authorities for everything that happened here /? [Russell_Vancamp] We blame the responsible hired employees of this county to do their job correctly and do it right and not just go through every day on a rote type situation /.	45
happen.v.426	happen.v	happen	v	[Russell_Vancamp] This guy should have never been let out and should have never been given a bond /. [Russell_Vancamp] and had they done their job right back there and had uh in- invesigated it properly in this information age that we we have it is my opinion and the families ' opinion this would have not happened /. [Russell_Vancamp] But we want to stop this from happening in the future /.	56
happen.v.427	happen.v	happen	v	[Russell_Vancamp] and had they done their job right back there and had uh in- invesigated it properly in this information age that we we have it is my opinion and the families ' opinion this would have not happened /. [Russell_Vancamp] But we want to stop this from happening in the future /. [Dan_Abrams] Yeah well look I think we uh we all do /.	48
happen.v.428	happen.v	happen	v	[Dan_Abrams] all I 've heard is skepticism about the threat /. [Dan_Abrams] If it happens then you want to blame Bush for not acting /. [Dan_Abrams] If he does he 's trying to walk the dog /.	14
happen.v.429	happen.v	happen	v	[Chris_Matthews] And he 's with most people on the social issues /. [speaker1] Well I happen to think that the way Karl Rove and George Bush are trying to redefine the issue which is about domestic security /- [speaker1] They do n't want to talk about the war because the war 's a mess /.	15
happen.v.430	happen.v	happen	v	[Darryl_Littlejohn] And they have to be -- [Darryl_Littlejohn] The family has to be devastated /. [Darryl_Littlejohn] I mean I 'm truly I 'm truly sorry what happened to this young lady /. [Darryl_Littlejohn] but they have the wrong person /.	26
happen.v.431	happen.v	happen	v	[Ray_Kelly] You know when that becomes a crime I think we should all get out of this business /. [Dan_Abrams] But but the problem Gail Abramson is it is a crime if the -- if the bar manager lied to the authorities about what happened led them on a wild goose chase /. [Dan_Abrams] um You 're allowed to say nothing /.	44
happen.v.432	happen.v	happen	v	[Sally] um You know I 'm -- I 'm beyond that at this point /. [Sally] I I I have to tell you that I uh when all of this first happened I you know I saw this young teacher /. [Sally] She is not my son 's student /.	31
happen.v.433	happen.v	happen	v	[Alyssa_Rayburger] I 'm Alyssa Rayburger /. [Alyssa_Rayburger] and here 's what 's happening /. [Alyssa_Rayburger] Authorities say the wife and three young daughters of a murdered Tennessee minister were found safe and alone on a Thursday night in Alabama when police spotted their van /.	12
happen.v.434	happen.v	happen	v	[Dan_Abrams] You spoke to her father /. [Dan_Abrams] um You know she 's saying that this was perfectly clear what happened that she starts goes home with this guy at age fourteen and then he effectively locks her in the home /. [Karen_Wells] That 's what she says /.	20
happen.v.435	happen.v	happen	v	[Alex_Thier] and many of those same people are back in power /. [Alex_Thier] And Afghanistan really represents something that 's happening in the broader Islamic world which is a tension between democratic values on one hand and Islamic values on the other hand /. [Dan_Abrams] I mean because the Afghan constitution ar- article two point two says followers of other religions are free to exercise their faith and perform their religious rights within the limits of the provisions of law /.	20
happen.v.436	happen.v	happen	v	[Dan_Abrams] Well let me ask you about /- [Dan_Abrams] I mean since you were involved in helping them create their constitution and their law wh- when you were helping them do that did you foresee something like this maybe happening /? [Alex_Thier] We absolutely did /.	39
happen.v.437	happen.v	happen	v	[Alex_Thier] You 're right Dan /. [Alex_Thier] it 's a travesty um that something like this could happen anywhere in the world /. [Alex_Thier] And I think that it really contains a very important lesson for us in that we really need to pay close attention not to just broad questions like elections but specifically the law in countries like this /.	17
happen.v.438	happen.v	happen	v	[Dan_Abrams] I mean is the President going to be able to work on this diplomatically as he says and with the people that they have contacts with and resolve this /? [Dan_Abrams] I mean it sounds like what 's going to happen is the government 's going to declare this guy mentally ill /. [Alex_Thier] Well I think that the government is is really looking for a way out of this /.	41
happen.v.439	happen.v	happen	v	[David_Gregory] Everybody up there in New York understands that as well that he can push the the ~US agenda /. [David_Gregory] And then we 'll see what happens /. [David_Gregory] I mean if he can prove to some Democrats that uh he can work well with others up there perhaps he changes some minds /.	27
happen.v.440	happen.v	happen	v	[David_Gregory] I mean if he can prove to some Democrats that uh he can work well with others up there perhaps he changes some minds /. [David_Gregory] Maybe that 's -- uh that 's not going to happen /. [David_Gregory] but the bottom line this is that this is not an administration that thinks very highly of the United Nations /.	37
happen.v.441	happen.v	happen	v	[Norm_Coleman] It was -- it was a meeting in which they 're talking about one world government /. [Norm_Coleman] He was saying hey folks it 's not going to happen /. [Chris_Matthews] Oh do n't /.	29
happen.v.442	happen.v	happen	v	[Chris_Matthews] Uh I do n't think so /. [Norm_Coleman] It 's not going to happen /. [Norm_Coleman] And the bottom line is that a lot of folks would say the ~UN has not been as effective as it should be /.	14
happen.v.443	happen.v	happen	v	[Norm_Coleman] That 's why the president is going to be speaking there /. [Norm_Coleman] And he has got a guy by his side who can help make that happen /. [Chris_Matthews] So I should n't have quoted him /.	28
happen.v.444	happen.v	happen	v	[Norm_Coleman] Yes it did /. [Norm_Coleman] I wish it did n't happen /. [Chris_Matthews] Do you think the ~UN can still play the role that ~FDR and the other Americans at that time thought it could of being the peacemaking uh organization to keep us from fighting war after war in the world /?	11
happen.v.445	happen.v	happen	v	[Ben_Ginsberg] Yeah I think John Bolton is going to surprise people the ~UN /- [Chris_Matthews] Will they -- will that happen /? [Ben_Ginsberg] Yes depending on the election results /.	20
happen.v.446	happen.v	happen	v	[Steve_McMahon] Well this investigation they never put a reporter in jail -- they never put a reporter in jail for something /. [Steve_McMahon] In fact it 's never happened before /. [Ben_Ginsberg] /.	28
happen.v.447	happen.v	happen	v	[Chris_Matthews] uh uh he means in chains /. [Chris_Matthews] Do you think that is going to happen /? [Steve_McMahon] I I think that 's unlikely /.	16
happen.v.448	happen.v	happen	v	[Chris_Matthews] How do we know that those bullies wo n't eventually grab control again the minute we leave Melanie /? [Melanie_Morgan] We have no idea what 's going to happen /. [Melanie_Morgan] I 'm not uh uh uh a psychic /.	29
happen.v.449	happen.v	happen	v	[Chris_Matthews] The same question to you Paul /. [Chris_Matthews] You know in the beginning of World War Two the worst thing that happened uh in the century uh the uh the French army was bigger and more impressive than the German army /. [Chris_Matthews] but the German army wanted to kill /.	22
happen.v.450	happen.v	happen	v	[Chris_Matthews] We 're back with radio talk show host Melanie Morgan and Iraq war veteren Paul Rieckhoff /. [Chris_Matthews] Melanie how do we get the straight scoop on what 's happening in Iraq because people tell me there 's only two ways to go over there as a journalist I think your experience confirms this you either go over there and stay in the green zone or that that part of uh uh which is very secure and it 's basically a compound or you go out with a unit as an embedded -- uh basically part of the unit an embedded reporter /. [Chris_Matthews] You never really get to mix with the locals /.	30
happen.v.451	happen.v	happen	v	[Paul_Rieckhoff] There 's a likelihood that I 'll go back while Ms. Morgan is back at her radio show /. [Paul_Rieckhoff] So what I really want to do is educate the public about the truth of what 's happening there /. [Paul_Rieckhoff] And I think the reality is that when people like her go over there there 's a public affairs officer standing right next to that young soldier /.	38
happen.v.452	happen.v	happen	v	[Sherrod_Brown] and we 're seeing exactly the opposite /. [Sherrod_Brown] But what happened in southwest Ohio Secretary Blackwell 's right /. [Sherrod_Brown] it 's a -- it 's a wake-up call with a message /.	12
happen.v.453	happen.v	happen	v	[Ken_Blackwell] Let me just say to you Chris that what I said was that Ron- Ronald Reagan and George Bush cut taxes and they started to restrain state government spending /. [Ken_Blackwell] What has happened in the state of Ohio is that Bob Taft has increased spending and he has in fact raised taxes /. [Ken_Blackwell] And I think that anybody that runs on a tax raising runaway spending platform is going to lose because they 're going to undercut our base /.	34
happen.v.454	happen.v	happen	v	[Mike_Gowan] and it says the Holy Koran /. [Mike_Gowan] So the idea is to show uh lawmakers the better part of what 's happening there /. [Mike_Gowan] Each of the guides pointed out to us the black uh arrows that you see everywhere are showing where Mecca is /.	23
happen.v.455	happen.v	happen	v	[Collette_Cassidy] I 'm Collette Cassidy /. [Collette_Cassidy] Here 's what 's happening /. [Collette_Cassidy] Fourteen ~US marines were killed when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb near Haditha in western Iraq /.	11

Maybe the problem is a political system that wo n't act without an `` exchange of letters , '' that insists on running foreign policy by committee , that treats a president as just another guy at the table . The reply of the Metzenbaums and Cohens is that we ca n't abolish these oversight committees because we 've seen too many abuses of executive power .	49

Though I agree with many of Mr. Kageyama 's comments , I believe he points the gun in the wrong direction : It is n't the Americans who must be criticized for not understanding the Japanese culture , but the Japanese who insist on forcing their culture on Americans . The Japanese want us to accept their culture , but they refuse to accept the American culture .	71
insist.v.74	insist.v	insist	v	European multinationals do likewise ; even in America , their affiliates are usually run by American managers .

insist.v.76	insist.v	insist	v	In Birmingham , which is 57 % black , whites are the minority . Insisting that they are protected by the Voting Rights Act , a group of whites brought a federal suit in 1987 to demand that the city abandon at-large voting for the nine member City Council and create nine electoral districts , including four safe white districts . The white group argued that whites were not fully and fairly represented , because in city-wide elections only black candidates or white candidates who catered to `` black interests '' could win .	14

insist.v.79	insist.v	insist	v	But even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as $ 100 billion between now and the year 2000 to convert to other coolants , foaming agents and solvents and to redesign equipment for these less efficient substitutes , the Montreal Protocol 's legions of supporters say it is worth it . They insist that CFCs are damaging the earth 's stratospheric ozone layer , which screens out some of the sun 's ultraviolet rays . Hence , as they see it , if something is n't done earthlings will become ever more subject to sunburn and skin cancer .	57
insist.v.80	insist.v	insist	v	With some new rules , state officials say they made it easier -- and faster -- to sell new franchises whose terms stray from those in state-registered contracts . Previously , regulators insisted that franchisers pre-register such changes with the state -- a costly process taking at least six weeks . Now some negotiated sales that meet a series of tests do n't have to be pre-registered .	32

SMALL TALK :	36
insist.v.82	insist.v	insist	v	A master of pork-barrel politics , he had crafted the $ 2.85 billion package in vintage style and used the full force of his chairmanship to keep the proposal intact and dismiss any alternative . When Mr. Fazio offered the California-backed $ 3.84 billion plan , Mr. Whitten insisted that the full 14 pages be read aloud by the panel 's clerk to underscore the range of legislative changes also sought by the delegation . On the chairman 's motion , the California package was subsequently reduced to less-binding report language , and even when this was accepted as such on a voice vote , Mr. Whitten pointedly opposed it .	48

Administration officials insist that the size of the staff was n't a problem during the Panama crisis . But one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the NSC staffer most experienced in Latin America , Everett Briggs , was gone .	33
insist.v.85	insist.v	insist	v	But his complaint that `` Days of Rage '' does n't contain balanced comments from Israelis about how badly the Palestinians are behaving is irrelevant . It 's like doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how terrific white South Africans are . This film did emphasize how long the Israeli\/Palestinian stalemate has existed by tracing the conflict to the days of World War I when the British tried to guarantee both a Jewish state and a Palestinian state without specifying how it was to be done .	35
insist.v.86	insist.v	insist	v	Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves , such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq , could upset the market . The Iraqi oil minister and Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act responsibly to maintain a stable market . However , in interviews later , both ministers stressed that they expect future OPEC quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member .	38
insist.v.87	insist.v	insist	v	Saudi Arabia , OPEC 's kingpin , also has surfaced as a possible obstacle , some OPEC sources said . Insisting on a 24.5 % share of any ceiling , Saudi officials have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to all members . In Geneva , however , they supported Iran 's proposal because it would have left the Saudi percentage of the OPEC total intact , and increased actual Saudi volume to nearly 5.3 million barrels daily from five million .	20
insist.v.88	insist.v	insist	v	Though tiny , that 's a reduction in its share . Mr. Nazer , the Saudi oil minister , reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on maintaining its percentage share of OPEC production under any quota revisions . `` Under any circumstances , Saudi Arabia should get more '' rather than less , Mr. Nazer said .	25
insist.v.89	insist.v	insist	v	Mr. Platt is advising clients that `` the near-term direction of bond prices is likely to remain upward . '' Analysts insist that even without help from a shaky stock market , which provided a temporary boost for bonds during the Oct. 13 stock market plunge , bond prices will start to climb on the prospects that the Federal Reserve will allow interest rates to move lower in the coming weeks . That would be comforting to fixed-income investors , many of whom were badly burned in the third quarter by incorrectly assuming that the Fed would ease .	21
insist.v.90	insist.v	insist	v	Total return is price changes plus interest income . Now some investment analysts insist that the economic climate has turned cold and gloomy , and they are urging clients to buy bonds before the rally begins .

insist.v.92	insist.v	insist	v	All this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city 's legitimate business element . Vincent M Ciavarella , regional manager of Property Management Systems , insists he does n't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6 million square feet of office space around Fashion Island that his company leases for Irvine Co. , the owner and developer of the project . Mr. Ciavarella has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided `` incomplete '' financial information and acknowledges that illegitimate operators `` are not easily detectable .	29

insist.v.94	insist.v	insist	v	At times , salesmen may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the person is being included in , '' says Mr. Cunningham . In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts , the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others . It also adds to the mystery of the venture .	52

insist.v.98	insist.v	insist	v	Arab officials in Saudi Arabia said three-week-old talks by Lebanese lawmakers aimed at ending Lebanon 's civil war appeared about to collapse . Christian legislators are insisting on a Syrian troop pullout from Lebanon before agreeing to political changes giving the nation 's Moslems a greater role in Beirut 's government .

When U.S. diplomats complained to the CIA of Col. Noriega 's moonlighting , intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans . `` Early on in the State Department , we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel , in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States , '' recalls Francis J.

observe.v.11	observe.v	observe	v	And when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious mind is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind . Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence . The question becomes , `` What is a dream '' ? ?	58
observe.v.12	observe.v	observe	v	How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism ? ? And if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the Trial , as we shall observe later , all but scuttled in the attempt to prove Eichmann a `` fiend '' ? ? These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case .	55

observe.v.15	observe.v	observe	v	And the emphasis on nationalism in America is in proportion to the growth of American influence across the world . Thus , if we are to observe American folklore in the twentieth century , we will do well to establish the relationships between folklore , nationalism and imperialism at the outset . Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence .	26
observe.v.16	observe.v	observe	v	The luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism Noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence of the sea . Japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs ; ; the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom-living diatoms , raised to the surface by the disturbance . The waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3,000 feet .	35
observe.v.17	observe.v	observe	v	`` When you marry , you want to have things in common '' , a girl said , `` and it 's hard when you do n't marry someone with your own background '' . A fourteen-year-old girl from the Middle West observed wryly that , in her community , religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities -- at least with the peripheral activities that many middle class Jews now regard as religious . It appears that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because she would not travel on Saturday and , in addition , required kosher food .	42
observe.v.18	observe.v	observe	v	In upper teen Jewish life , the non-college group tends to have a sense of marginality . `` People automatically assume that I 'm in college '' , a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably . However , among the girls , there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going to college .	31
observe.v.19	observe.v	observe	v	And the rebellion of these third generation Jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but , rather , a protest against a culture that they view as softly and insidiously enveloping . `` As long as I 'm home , I 'll never grow up '' , a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly . `` They do n't like it if I do anything away from home .	51

It may be a bit cold when poured ; ; but again , as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt , wine should be served in a large , tulip-shaped glass , which is never filled more than half full . In this way , red wine warms of itself quite rapidly -- and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal -LRB- or the course -RRB- , in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages .	49
observe.v.21	observe.v	observe	v	Steinberg claims that these early years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career . `` By observing the conductor '' , he says with a twinkle in his eyes , `` I learned how not to conduct '' .

observe.v.22	observe.v	observe	v	In the meantime , while the South has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization that is so disappointing to the curious Yankee , Southern writers have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region 's progress . Willard Thorp , in his new book , American Writing In The Twentieth Century , observes , quite validly it seems : `` Certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched . No Southern novelist has done for Atlanta or Birmingham what Herrick , Dreiser , and Farrell did for Chicago or Dos Passos did for New York .	52

observe.v.24	observe.v	observe	v	For this change is not a change from one positive position to another , but a change from order and truth to disorder and negation . The liberal-conservative division , we might observe in passing , is not of itself directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle between ruling groups . Rather it is rooted in a difference of response to the threat of social disintegration .	32
observe.v.25	observe.v	observe	v	And it would seem that history is a witness to this truth . As a further characterization of the liberal conservative split we may observe that it involves differences in the formula for escaping inevitabilities in history . These differences , in turn , derive from prior differences concerning the friendly or hostile character of change .	24

In America , Meyer Schapiro observed that , unlike the Mondrian school , Helion `` sought a return path to the fullness of nature within the framework of abstract art '' . It is notable that at this time he was writing with admiration of Cimabue 's and Poussin 's way of filling space .	50

Now , it 's lying in something over 300 feet of water , so if you can just visualize it being turned on its end , it would stick out of the sea about 200 feet .

lie.v.20	lie.v	lie	v	That is , locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location , but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment . If the wedding party lasted late , and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before resuming the trip or making an early start , the husband may forestall tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying in each other 's arms will be bliss enough for these few hours . The consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time -LRB- day or night -RRB- for that purpose .	73
lie.v.21	lie.v	lie	v	Under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases , providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration . Extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall -LRB- the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back -RRB- may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin . But during the same examination , two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall -LRB- the bottom of the vagina in the same position -RRB- without any pain ; ; and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times .	61
lie.v.22	lie.v	lie	v	Other experts say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period , it is likely to shake the marriage . And just as domination today often begins with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband . `` To get a marriage back where it belongs '' , comments Dr. Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute , `` the husband must take some very basic steps .	48

Then , by squeezing her foot three times , he came up -- presto -- with a different diagnosis with each squeeze .	41
lie.v.25	lie.v	lie	v	Soil type , drainage , or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones . Small areas that are n't right for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop . The house	31
lie.v.26	lie.v	lie	v	Public relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic-fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried out : Too much , too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect . And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot . Most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant 's Department of Jewish Affairs .	88
lie.v.27	lie.v	lie	v	These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case . It might be contended , of course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism . But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment .	29
lie.v.28	lie.v	lie	v	What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable Anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute ? ? Not in Eichmann 's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial . No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them today .	49
lie.v.29	lie.v	lie	v	To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment . This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief . Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : The civil law is concerned with public crimes .	51
lie.v.30	lie.v	lie	v	The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear . A century of exploration had established that a great land mass , North and South America , lay between Europe and the Indies .

lie.v.32	lie.v	lie	v	Thomas Douglas , fifth Earl of Selkirk , a noble humanitarian Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands , conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red River of the North . Since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson 's Bay Company , he purchased great blocks of the Comany 's stock with the view to controlling its policies . Having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers .	46
lie.v.33	lie.v	lie	v	A Yank , disturbed by his increasing corpulence , wrote : `` I am growing so fat I am a burden 2 myself '' . Another Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer : `` now I lay me down to sleep , the gray-backs o'er my body creep ; ; if they should bite before I wake , I pray the Lord their jaws to break '' . Charles Thiot , a splendid Georgia soldier , differed from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation , well-educated , and nearly fifty years of age .	36
lie.v.34	lie.v	lie	v	It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine . After all , the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen 's comprehension and control . Anyone 's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement .	47
lie.v.35	lie.v	lie	v	But as November 1924 drew close the Democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O'Banion was being wooed by the opposition , and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans . To forestall any change of allegiance , the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O'Banion , as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay . The reception was held in a private dining room of the Webster Hotel on Lincoln Park West .	65
lie.v.36	lie.v	lie	v	Woman 's place is in the home : man must attend to matters of the yard . One of the vexatious problems to first confront President Kennedy was the property lying just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House . Congress had already appropriated money , and plans were well along to tear down the buildings flanking Lafayette Square and replace them with what one critic calls the `` marble monumentality '' of government office buildings .	30
lie.v.37	lie.v	lie	v	There might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise ; ; only -- there was not . They lay , with the birds hopping from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them . No one came '' .	23

lie.v.39	lie.v	lie	v	Those who actually get there find that it is n't spooky at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight . But even for them it remains a museum , or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb , a tomb in which Persia lies well preserved but indeed dead . Everyone is ready to grant the Persians their history , but almost no one is willing to acknowledge their present .	48
lie.v.40	lie.v	lie	v	The singer simply matches the poem to a mode ; ; for example , the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem : `` They brought me news that Spring is in the plains And Ahmad 's blood the crimson tulip stains ; ; Go , tell his aged mother that her son Fought with a thousand foes , and he was one '' . Or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet : `` Know ye , fair folk who dwell on earth Or shall hereafter come to birth , That here , with dust upon his eyes , Iraj , the sweet-tongued singer , lies . In this true lover 's tomb interred A world of love lies sepulchred . ''	111
lie.v.41	lie.v	lie	v	Or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet : `` Know ye , fair folk who dwell on earth Or shall hereafter come to birth , That here , with dust upon his eyes , Iraj , the sweet-tongued singer , lies .

lie.v.42	lie.v	lie	v	He must rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other . He must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap .	27
lie.v.43	lie.v	lie	v	Even so , confusion in this period gained such strength -LRB- from compromise and other factors -RRB- that it led to the bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century . Nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty . The present issue in Atlantica -- whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens -- resembles the American one of 1787-89 rather than the one that was resolved by Civil War .	44
lie.v.44	lie.v	lie	v	These are not , however , differences in federal structure . The only important differences from that standpoint , between the two Constitutions , lies in their Preambles . The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states , whereas the Preamble of 1787-89 expressed , as clearly as language can , the opposite concept , that they were acting directly as citizens .	24
lie.v.45	lie.v	lie	v	In the life sciences , there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease , in the mechanisms of heredity , and in bio - and physiological chemistry . The major effect of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment . In addition , our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed .	39
lie.v.46	lie.v	lie	v	What one actually remembers is its greenness . From high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible . One looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking wave of flower .	17
lie.v.47	lie.v	lie	v	That world was in scale with my own smallness . I have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole -- that I could not see -- but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory : wind-blown , frost-bitten , white chrysanthemums beneath a window , with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of November ; ; ripe pears lying in long grass , to be turned over by a dusty-slippered foot , cautiously , lest bees still worked in the ragged , brown-edged holes ; ; hot-colored verbenas in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch , where we passed on our way to the pump with the half-gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it . It was mother who planted the verbenas .	66
lie.v.48	lie.v	lie	v	We were not , however , entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street . We were forbidden to swing on the gates , lest they sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way , but we could stand on them , when they were latched , rest our chins on the top , and stare and stare , committing to memory , quite unintentionally , all the details that lay before our eyes . The street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees , and silence was a weight , almost palpable , in the air .	71
lie.v.49	lie.v	lie	v	There is no more `` plot '' than that ; ; only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give . The artistic interest , then , lies in what the encounter may be made to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness . The first sentence , with its platitudinous irony , announces an emblematic intent : `` The way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad , ran beside it all the way to the end ; ; that is to say , to the churchyard '' .	34
lie.v.50	lie.v	lie	v	In one of his summers at home he married , to the great disapproval of his father , who objected because of his extreme youth . Deciding to become a painter , he entered the studio of Gerome in Paris , where he enjoyed the life of the artists , but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction . He gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , `` The Happy Artists '' .	61
lie.v.51	lie.v	lie	v	The discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded us that in the historical perspective the President 's decision will finally clarify itself as a moral , rather than a medical , problem . Because the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with the President , rather than with his doctors , nothing raises more surely for us the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems under political pressure . For the President had dealt with the matter humbly , in what he conceived as the democratic way .	39
lie.v.52	lie.v	lie	v	The response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is vanishing . Its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through the repression of disruptive forces . To this end political authority is called upon to exercise its negative and coercive powers .	16
lie.v.53	lie.v	lie	v	Only the strong look squarely at weakness . The maturity in this point of view lies in its recognition that no basic problem is ever solved without being clearly understood . Mr. Lyford continues : `` Even if the self portrait we distribute for popular consumption were accurate it would be dangerous to present it as a picture of the ideal society .	15
lie.v.54	lie.v	lie	v	Perhaps the mere fact that by plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most ordinary of us , temporarily anyway , the sleeping poet , and in poets can discover their immortality , is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to which we can attest ? ? One can see it as humiliating that an extra hormone casually fed into our chemistry may induce us to lay down our lives for a lover or a friend ; ; one can take it as no more than another veil torn from the mystery of the soul . But it could also be looked at from the other end of the spectrum .	70
lie.v.55	lie.v	lie	v	His hands , which had been as quick as a pair of fluttering birds , were now neither active nor really relaxed . They lay on his lap , palms up , stiffly motionless , the tapered fingers a little thick at the joints . Altogether he had , since the seizure , the appearance of a boy who overindulged in food and took no exercise .	24
lie.v.56	lie.v	lie	v	He was able , now , to sit for hours in a chair in the living room and stare out at the bleak yard without moving . His hands lay loosely , yet stiffly -- they were like wax hands : almost lifelike , not quite -- folded in his lap ; ; his mouth hung slightly open . When he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was inescapable , he would answer ; ; if , as often happened , he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly , he would repeat his words in the same way , without emphasis or impatience , only a little louder .	29
lie.v.57	lie.v	lie	v	Warren handed him the metal box and Prevot quietly disappeared down the line . Lying in the grass behind the brush clump , Warren looked about . The others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and the brush .	14
lie.v.58	lie.v	lie	v	It spread to most of the audience and was often viewed by visiting whites who snickered behind handkerchief and afterward discussed Negro religion . It sometimes ended in death-like trances with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and floor . To most of those who composed the Amen corner it was a magnificent and beautiful experience , something for which they lived from week to week .	32
lie.v.59	lie.v	lie	v	He was tingling within . Before him , mutilated , bleeding to death , they lay . It was as if it had been done .	15
lie.v.60	lie.v	lie	v	So you 're not tryin , Johnson , you bastard you . He looked over at him , lying there , asleep , and he felt a wave of revulsion . How he loathed him .	18
lie.v.61	lie.v	lie	v	The redcoat officer collapsed like a punctured bolster , and the horse reared and threw him from the saddle , except that one booted foot caught in the stirrup . Half crazed by the weight dragging , the dust , and the heat , the horse leaped our wall , dashing out the rider 's brains against it , and leaving him lying there among us -- while the horse crashed away through the brush . It was my initiation to war and the insane symphony war plays ; ; for what had happened on the common was only terror and flight ; ; but this grinning , broken head , not ten feet away from me , was the sharp definition of what my reality had become .	62
lie.v.62	lie.v	lie	v	A dozen cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane , as perhaps we were at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road , and the thirst of some of the men , which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it . Isaac Pitt , one of the men from Lincoln , had taken a musket ball in his belly ; ; and though he had found the strength to run with us , now he collapsed and lay on the ground , dying , the Reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow . It may appear that we were cruel and callous , but no one had time to spend sympathizing with poor Isaac -- except the Reverend .	105
lie.v.63	lie.v	lie	v	Cousin Joshua and some others felt that we should march toward Lexington and take up new positions ahead of the slow-moving British column , but another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this section of road . I did n't offer any advice , but I certainly did not want to go back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out . Someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it , the British would be gone ; ; but Cousin Simmons said he had watched them marching west early in the morning , and moving at a much brisker pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass , what with the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition carts .	61
lie.v.64	lie.v	lie	v	Quickening his steps , John entered the vast church and climbed the tower steps to the bells . Underneath the big one , in the silent moonlight , lay a dead pigeon , and on the smaller bell , the Clemence , two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold winter air . John leaned upon the stone balustrade .	28
lie.v.65	lie.v	lie	v	It would be a sign for the untellable , and he , Adam , would understand . Now , Adam , in the gray light of afternoon , stared across at the hut opposite his tent , and thought of Simms Purdew lying in there in the gloom , snoring on his bunk , with the fumes of whisky choking the air . He saw the sign above the door of the hut : home sweet home .	42
lie.v.66	lie.v	lie	v	He felt the sweetness of pity flood through him , veining his very flesh . Those men , lying in the huts , they did not know . They did not know who they were or know their own worth .	18
lie.v.67	lie.v	lie	v	The dog refused to be scared off , so Kahler had purchased some small firecrackers . He would lay in wait in the garage , and when the terrier came scratching around , he 'd let fly with a cherry bomb . `` Scared the hell out of him '' , Kahler grinned .	18
lie.v.68	lie.v	lie	v	He stumbled into the house , eyes burning like fire . Argiento made him lie down on the bed , brought a pan of hot water , dipped some clean white linen cloth and applied it to extract the splinter . Though the pain was considerable Michelangelo was not too concerned .	14
lie.v.69	lie.v	lie	v	They put Kate to bed and wired Jonathan and sent for the young Presbyterian minister . He sat beside Kate 's bed with the others throughout the morning , talking , talking of God 's will , while Kate lay staring angrily at him . When he told her God had called the child to Him , she rejected his words rebelliously .	39
lie.v.70	lie.v	lie	v	Chapter 10 New York lay bleaching in the summer sun , and the morning fish hawk , flying in the heated air , saw below him the long triangular wedge of Manhattan Island . It was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into pig-infested streets , mostly around the Battery , going bravely north to Wall Street , but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of Harlem Heights .	4
lie.v.71	lie.v	lie	v	On the shores north and south , the fishers and mooncursers -- smugglers -- lived along the churning Great South Bay and the narrow barrier of sand , Fire Island . The morning hawk , hungry for any eatable , killable , digestible item , kept his eyes on the ring of anchored ships that lay off the shores in the bay , sheltered by the Jersey inlets . They often threw tidbits overboard .	55
lie.v.72	lie.v	lie	v	Eileen declared she could n't lift her head from the pillow . She lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling me where to look for the coffeepot . I was stumbling in my undershirt trying to find my way around her damn kitchenette when I smelt that sickish sweet hairtonic smell .	13
lie.v.73	lie.v	lie	v	I never felt such a lowdown hound in my life . First thing I knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the breakfast and I was handing Eileen her coffeecup and she was lying there handsome as a queen among her courtiers . I could n't face Thelma after that night .	34
lie.v.74	lie.v	lie	v	Where are you , Henry ? ? -- Make him lie down ! ! Watson snatched a deep breath .	10
lie.v.75	lie.v	lie	v	His name had been crossed off a list . Already his cool body lay in the ground . What words had any meaning ? ?	13
lie.v.76	lie.v	lie	v	In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves . During the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track , and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel tickets would still be lying , like leaves , in the gutters near Belmont and Saratoga . Maple and ash , beech and elm , one hundred to win on Three in the fourth , fifty to win on Six in the third , one hundred to win on Two in the eighth .	42
lie.v.77	lie.v	lie	v	She swung her eyes up to the blue of the window , her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans .

She ate .	22
lie.v.78	lie.v	lie	v	Not until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his contrition blotted out in one shameful moment of covetousness . He and Mark were the last of the family , and there lay the Cape Ann property which had seemed to have no end , stretching from horizon to horizon , in those golden days of summer . Now Abel turned his head to look at his brother .	44
lie.v.79	lie.v	lie	v	They seemed then to have had a single mind and body , a mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth , casually . He saw the Starbird as she lay , her slender mast up and gently turning , its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus sky . Both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting , ready , for the two of them to run up her sails .	33

Everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form : his models , drawings , ten-foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac . Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden Cycly Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house .	24
lie.v.83	lie.v	lie	v	The doctor opened the smallest of his cases , an unimposing straw bag , and exposed the contents for Alex 's inspection . Inside , carefully packed in straw , were six eggs , but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside ; ; to Alex they were merely six not unusual hens ' eggs . There was little enough time to contemplate them , however ; ; in an instant the doctor was stalking across the room with an antique ledger in his hands , thoroughly eared and big as a table top .	49
lie.v.84	lie.v	lie	v	He was standing in front of the mirror , tightening his tie . He had on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat , and his brief case lay on the bench . `` I do n't know what you think you 've been doing about my clothes '' , he said .	29
lie.v.85	lie.v	lie	v	Winston folded the tissue paper carefully . `` He 's used it every day ; ; every morning , I lay out his clothes on it '' . `` Well , that 's over now .	20
lie.v.86	lie.v	lie	v	The night after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle -- it must have been late in September -- I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from The Front , nearly dying , my head bandaged and blooded , and Jessica bending over me , the power of her love bringing me back to life . For many nights afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires , would cause me to lie awake in shame , tossing with irresolution , longing to fall into a deep sleep . The weeks went by , and the longer our separation grew , the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies became .	93
lie.v.87	lie.v	lie	v	It seemed incredible , as I listened to the monotonous drone of voices and smelled the fetid odors coming from the patients , that technically I was a ward of the state of Illinois , going to a hospital for the mentally ill . I suddenly thought of Mary Jane Brennan , the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger , her quiet competence , the gentleness and sweetness that lay just beneath the surface of her defenses . We had become good friends during my stay at Cook County Hospital .	71
lie.v.88	lie.v	lie	v	`` All right '' , I said . `` Why do n't you bastards lay off for a while '' ? ? `` I beg your pardon , sir '' ? ?	14
lie.v.89	lie.v	lie	v	And was he afraid to do anything as definite as releasing her ? ? Her heart was thumping painfully ; ; the unknown was so much worse than -- what dangers lay ahead for her ? ? What awful thing had she to face in the next few hours ? ?	31
lie.v.90	lie.v	lie	v	`` Get in '' , Charley Estes said brusquely . He staggered into the back seat and lay back , fighting for breath . There was someone in front with the sheriff .	17
lie.v.91	lie.v	lie	v	The sound of his head striking the solid wood was an ultimate , sudden-end sound . He fell on his side across the lowest step , rolled over once , then lay still . Mickey found himself leaning against the desk , with stiff hands , panting for breath .	31
lie.v.92	lie.v	lie	v	There 's no other way ; ; I 'll have to do it myself . He looked at where Roberts lay sprawled on the step . Mickey was sure now he was dead .	20
lie.v.93	lie.v	lie	v	He got to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the pit . The body lay in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel floor . Deep enough , he decided .	16
lie.v.94	lie.v	lie	v	Quickly , he went into the bedroom . The bed still showed signs of where Kitti had lain . Gilborn stood there for a long time .	17
lie.v.95	lie.v	lie	v	The bed was empty now . Kitti would lie in it no more . He would lie in it no more .	8
lie.v.96	lie.v	lie	v	Kitti would lie in it no more . He would lie in it no more . Gilborn wondered whether Kitti had lain in that same bed with Who ? ?	10
lie.v.97	lie.v	lie	v	He would lie in it no more . Gilborn wondered whether Kitti had lain in that same bed with Who ? ? For thirty minutes , Stanley Gilborn stood there .	13
lie.v.98	lie.v	lie	v	Why , Holden said to himself , surprised at his own sudden insight , I 'll bet some of those people who enter are just as happy as can be . They 've worried , they 've lain awake nights , they 've shook at the slightest footstep , they 've pictured their own destruction , and now it 's all over and they can give up . Sure , they 're giving up hope .	37
lie.v.99	lie.v	lie	v	And then you wiped up some grease '' . She had caught him off guard , no preparation , nothing certain but that ahead lay some kind of disaster . `` No .	24
lie.v.100	lie.v	lie	v	Motive . Here , too , the cause to hate lay well back in the years . But bitterness had more cause to remain , even increasingly to corrode .	10
lie.v.101	lie.v	lie	v	It contained a desk , files , a typewriter on a stand , and two big leather armchairs . A newspaper open at stock-market reports lay on one of them . Thayer folded it up and offered a drink .	25
lie.v.102	lie.v	lie	v	He stared at the report in Killpath 's hand , sure it was written by Accacia -- just as sure as if he 'd submitted it in his scrawled longhand . He sucked in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet again , wound the gold-wire stems of his glasses around his ears and then , eying the report as it lay before him on the desk , intoned , `` Acting Lieutenant Gunnar Matson one failed to see that the station keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the station 's activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the Homicide Detail of the Inspector 's Bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander Acting Captain O.T. Killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five frequented extralegal establishments known as after-hours spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six '' -- he leaned back and peeled off his glasses `` -- failed to co-operate with the Acting Captain by returning promptly when so ordere What have you to say to that , Sergeant '' ? ?	65
lie.v.103	lie.v	lie	v	Not yet . It was nine o'clock in the morning : the hour which , like a spade turning clods of earth , exposed to the day a myriad of busy creatures that had lain dormant in the quiet night . Mission Street at this hour was populated by a whole community that Gun could not have seen on his tour of duty -- the neighborhood that had known Urbano Quintana by day .	34
lie.v.104	lie.v	lie	v	She shook her head . I knew she was lying . I stood there , staring at her for a moment -- thinking mostly of her beauty and her poverty .	9
lie.v.105	lie.v	lie	v	There was no sound and apparently no movement in the room except the noiseless pulsation of the red light on the wall . He lay still , listening to the silence , watching the light . Somewhere in the city a big clock sounded twelve solemn notes -- midnight .	24
lie.v.106	lie.v	lie	v	The blue rug had been rolled up and stacked in one corner of the room . On the bare floorboards a man lay face down . He had a short , heavy , powerful body .	22
lie.v.107	lie.v	lie	v	Mike liked having light up through the ripples ; ; it was a goodness , beauty . They picnicked by the pool , then lay back on the grass and looked at stars . `` Mike , there 's Mars .	24
lie.v.108	lie.v	lie	v	Meanwhile , all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship , went into the suspensor . Here they would lie in suspended animation for many years . Some time later , after a check had been made of all automatic equipment , the crew would join the others .	26
lie.v.109	lie.v	lie	v	This would be the fifth mapping expedition to the planetoids of Yancy-6 in three generations . They lay months away from the nearest Earth star by jump drive , and no one knew what they were good for , although it was felt that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discovered -- much like the continent of Antarctica in ancient history . `` How can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely '' ? ? Ryan asked .	17
lie.v.110	lie.v	lie	v	`` No , it is n't '' , Ekstrohm said . `` I think we 'd better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the ecological setup around here . In the meantime , we might be thinking on the problem all these dead beasts represent .	19
lie.v.111	lie.v	lie	v	These critters went real sudden '' . Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and thought , the camp is quiet . The Earthmen made camp outside the spaceship .	8
lie.v.112	lie.v	lie	v	Each man had a bubble to himself , privacy after the long period of enforced intimacy on board the ship . Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened to the sounds of the night on Yancey-6 138 . There was a keening of wind , and a cracking of the frozen ground .	22
lie.v.113	lie.v	lie	v	Insects there were on the world , but they were frozen solid during the night , only to revive and thaw in the morning sun . The bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on board . Yet he knew the others were sleeping more soundly , now that they had renewed their contact with the matter that had birthed them to send them riding high vacuum .	29
lie.v.114	lie.v	lie	v	What had changed for him ? ? He no longer had to lie in his bunk all night , his eyes closed , pretending to sleep . In privacy he could walk around , leave the light on , read .	12
lie.v.115	lie.v	lie	v	He stumbled and fell , but it did not hurt . The many-bodied girl lay near him . Mercer spoke to her .	14
lie.v.116	lie.v	lie	v	He forced himself to be deliberate . He rammed his mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert , `` That was a good bite . Maybe I will grow another head .	20
lie.v.117	lie.v	lie	v	She meant him well , but was in no condition for articulate speech . The half-man lay on the ground , arteries pulsating prettily behind the half-transparent film which protected his abdominal cavity . Mercer squeezed the man 's shoulder .	16
lie.v.118	lie.v	lie	v	They were dirty , their clothes were torn , and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door . She lay there , making no effort to get back on her feet . The boy came on to the porch and sat down , his gaze on Morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring .	30
lie.v.119	lie.v	lie	v	`` He 's not your brother , he 's Gavin 's son . You see , he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone '' . Joe Purvis was thinking back many years .	17
lie.v.120	lie.v	lie	v	He started to run but Oso 's shot caught him on the wing . He jerked once in the grass and lay still . `` If you 're goin ' to kill 'em -- ! ! Kill 'em '' ! ! Oso growled .	21
lie.v.121	lie.v	lie	v	And determined not to show it . They lay a little too stiffly , with their eyes straining to stay closed . `` Go to sleep '' , he said .	8
lie.v.122	lie.v	lie	v	It was , I felt , possible that they were men who , having received no tickets for that day , had remained in the hall , to sleep perhaps , in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light . This light did not penetrate very far back into the hall , and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when I tried to pick out whatever might be lying , or squatting , on the floor below . Also the clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder .	82
lie.v.123	lie.v	lie	v	I had signed it off on the forms . My future lay solely with the hall , yet what did I know about the hall at this point ? ? Although I had been inside it I had not yet seen it functioning .	11
lie.v.124	lie.v	lie	v	He too knew the agony of going for weeks , sometimes months without the solace of tobacco . Mitchell Barton drew in the fragrance deeply , letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat for a moment before he exhaled . Through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly .	29
lie.v.125	lie.v	lie	v	When they learn you 're in the hills though , they 'll rally , do n't worry about that '' . Barton waited for a long moment , then asked the question which lay always uppermost in his mind . `` My boy .	33
lie.v.126	lie.v	lie	v	Here , she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom . On her bureau lay a small , brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving -- an object which , Pamela believed now , had been the property of her great-grandfather , Major Hiram Munroe Culver . He had belonged to this land and , perhaps , had desecrated it -- and this was the only material symbol that remained of him .	23
lie.v.127	lie.v	lie	v	Perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed . Was it not possible , after all , that the forest was in league with her and her child that its sympathy lay with the Culvers that she had erred in failing to understand this ? ? Pamela felt calm and peaceful as she walked along .	42
lie.v.128	lie.v	lie	v	Houses of settlers who 'd treated the company herds as a natural resource , free for the taking , were sitting empty , with weeds growing high in their yards . The small half-heartedly tended fields of men who 'd spent more time rustling cattle than farming were lying fallow . No cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer .	48
lie.v.129	lie.v	lie	v	He shook loose straw out of the action , and placed the gun in his holster . Leaving Jess 's where it lay , he left the stall . `` Get up , Crouch .	22
lie.v.130	lie.v	lie	v	Johnson never would have believed she had a son that age . Mrs. Roebuck thought Johnson was a `` sweet bawh t'- lah lahk thet '' , but her Herman was getting to be a man , there was no getting around it . `` Just befoh he left foh his academeh we wuh hevin dack-rihs on the vuhranduh , Major Roebuck an Ah , an Huhmun says ' May Ah hev one too ' ? ?	22
lie.v.131	lie.v	lie	v	At the pool 's far end was the little cabana Joyce had mentioned , and on the water 's surface floated scattered lavender patches of limp-looking lather . A few yards beyond the group of men , a man 's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra . Lieutenant Rawlins , one of the plain-clothesmen , spotted me and said , `` Hi , Shell '' , and walked toward me .	42
lie.v.132	lie.v	lie	v	Mary Jane Lerner knew none of this . -RRB- Her Nicolas lay curled in the sun like a fawn , black hair falling over his eyes . She was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of a long meaningful search for truth .	11
lie.v.133	lie.v	lie	v	For three days , their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea . Molten glare singed their eyelids an angry crimson ; ; suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping ; ; dust choked their throats and lay like acid in their lungs . And the valley stretched endlessly out ahead , scorched and baked and writhing in its heat , until it vanished into the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze .	50
lie.v.134	lie.v	lie	v	And the valley stretched endlessly out ahead , scorched and baked and writhing in its heat , until it vanished into the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze . Ben Prime extended his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxen . `` Hoa-whup '' ! ! He commanded from his raw throat , and felt the pain of movement in his cracked , black burned lips .	39
lie.v.135	lie.v	lie	v	To his puzzlement , there suddenly was no haze . The valley lay clear , and open to the eye , right up to the sharp-limbed line of gaunt , scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead . Then he noticed the clouds racing upon them -- heavy , ominous , leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced over the crests of the surrounding hills .	12
lie.v.136	lie.v	lie	v	He examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished . The waters lay muddy but placid , without a ripple of movement against the wheels ; ; there was not a match-width of damp mark to show they were receding . He doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate , dry hills that rimmed the valley .	17
lie.v.137	lie.v	lie	v	Maybe he was only doing the best he knew how , like any of us . Anyway , he does n't deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at . `` Ever see yourself spread out on the pavement , Benny '' ? ? He said to his partner .	23
lie.v.138	lie.v	lie	v	Never Benny . Whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt , Ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind . Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think .	7
lie.v.139	lie.v	lie	v	The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her . The man stood near the bent levi-clad body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car . The two drivers moved closer .	30
lie.v.140	lie.v	lie	v	There was a gentle concern in Benson 's voice . Ramey looked down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man 's tanned leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded , blood-flecked substance lying by itself on the pavement . `` But what is it '' ? ? The man said with a tone of impatience .	36
lie.v.141	lie.v	lie	v	Beyond his window were the greening trees , new spring , eternal hope , eternal life . There lay Grand Fair 's Quinzaine , his own young parents ' graves , but new life and promise for his sons , grandsons . He poured his thimble of wine for the toast he 'd made so often .	18
lie.v.142	lie.v	lie	v	She had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice . Only at this moment -- perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in Doaty 's bed -- she found herself examining how others might regard her . Perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice .	31
lie.v.143	lie.v	lie	v	She sounded so exactly like Doaty that Henrietta obeyed her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home . Folly danced , eager for whatever lay beyond the door . To a Blackwell , there was only one church .	29
lie.v.144	lie.v	lie	v	To a Blackwell , there was only one church . The cemetery slumbered just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea . For the first time in thirty years , Henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity .	20
lie.v.145	lie.v	lie	v	Rachel steered me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the Torah . Bits of trash lay in the roadway . The air smelled warmish and foul .	19
lie.v.146	lie.v	lie	v	`` Most of our Sabras think it 's horrible . When we were fighting , a few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass . They said that we must not fight but wait for the Messiah '' .	22
lie.v.147	lie.v	lie	v	I was amazed . You had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home . You had to be stupid or crazy or immortal .	10
lie.v.148	lie.v	lie	v	Out of the church and into his big car , it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college , his expansiveness , the quaint little pine board tourist courts , cabins really , with a cute naked light bulb in the ceiling -LRB- unfrosted and naked as a streetlight , like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid , where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs , watching in between your bouts at hopscotch -RRB- , a room complete with moths pinging the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls , an insect Highway Patrol with feelers waving . And the bed that sagged in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for overhearing talk in the next room when Gratt went out for ice , the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain , so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened . And Gratt Shafer would be in Memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would , just like everybody knew all along .	193
lie.v.149	lie.v	lie	v	Was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance ? ? He wondered . Would he have to clean up after her every day , clean the kitchen , the bathroom , and get down on his knees and scrub the kitchen floor , then hang up her dresses , pick up her stockings , make the bed while she lay around ? ? He straightened up , ready to vent his exasperation , then grew afraid .	62
lie.v.150	lie.v	lie	v	And in the morning when he woke up at ten the church bells were ringing . He had never heard so many bells , and as he lay there listening , he thought of her scolding him for his remarks when he had looked up at the obelisk and the church at the top of the Spanish Steps . It was a good thing that she clung to her religion , he thought .	27
lie.v.151	lie.v	lie	v	She said , `` There is nothing that concerns you here . Lie back and go to sleep . But do not dream .	12
lie.v.152	lie.v	lie	v	-LRB- If a dragon or a sea monster came along , did n't he have a red Swiss hunting knife on his belt -- ten blades and a corkscrew ? ? -RRB- Here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe . He was Canute controlling the waves .	38
lie.v.153	lie.v	lie	v	`` Name one , I been there '' . Japan , she said , smelled pugh because people let dead fish lie on the beaches till the fish got hard as rocks ; ; then they scraped off the mold and made fish soup . Pugh .	21
lie.v.154	lie.v	lie	v	She was silent for a while , then said , `` Why are you so unhappy '' ? ? `` I 'm not unhappy '' , I lied , staring at the snow . She was trying to make a hole in my armor , and I did n't want it .	27
lie.v.155	lie.v	lie	v	His interest in the formal study of religion waned when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in Asian affairs . Although he still did n't speak to anyone , he grew fond of saying , `` The future lies in Asia '' , when the opportunity arose , and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to New York to give him a foundation , they said , for his life in Asian studies . Richard was a solitary student in New York and acquired , in his remoteness , a thorough if bookish knowledge of Asian lore , literature , life , politics and history .	42
lie.v.156	lie.v	lie	v	`` Do you still have The Book of the Dead '' ? ? She asked him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you 'd like it '' . `` Yes '' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` I still have it '' . He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject .	51
lie.v.157	lie.v	lie	v	I had turned at the corner of the field and I had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth , and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway , and when I looked again down the furrow , the snake was there . It lay half in the furrow and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the clutch . The tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth , and the tractor stopped instantly .	56
lie.v.158	lie.v	lie	v	I had never liked snakes much , I still had that kind of quick panic that I 'd had as a child whenever I saw one , but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful . He was multi-colored and graceful and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only so slightly . Go out of the furrow , snake , I said , but it did not move at all .	45
lie.v.159	lie.v	lie	v	The pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life . Lying awake at night , he could see them , laid out on the floor of his mind . When he rose in the morning , the image was still there .	10
lie.v.160	lie.v	lie	v	He was wrong . The rest of the bedroom had been groomed to a superhuman neatness , but in the middle of the carpet lay the disheveled shorts . They gave the room a strange note of incongruity , like a mole on a beautiful face .	24
lie.v.161	lie.v	lie	v	Beside his shorts , he would place something of hers . Instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her panties , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same . He felt that it would be a particular humiliation to Dolores to pick up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor .	43
lie.v.162	lie.v	lie	v	To have her underclothes linked with his on the floor would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd . Something in the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence of the plan lay in his faith , that the idea would work because he believed in it , since his courage and virility were involved , because it was truly his . The knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death , and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted fanaticism .	37
lie.v.163	lie.v	lie	v	Perhaps it was his misfortune , or good fortune , whichever way one looked at it , to belong to the former group , and he was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded none , which was positively antagonistic to it . And then again perhaps the reason why he could n't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement : reading , roaming , gardening , lying on his back and watching the clouds go by , was because he did n't want to do them . There was no compulsion behind them .	79
lie.v.164	lie.v	lie	v	Mr. Mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn into a workbench . They lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile . Mr. Crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot .	39
lie.v.165	lie.v	lie	v	The Dharma Dictionary , a list of highly unusual terms used in connection with Eurasian proto-senility cults . It 's somewhat off the beaten track , to be sure , but therein lies its variety and charm . For example , probably very few people know that the word `` visrhanik '' that is bantered about so much today stems from the verb `` bouanahsha '' : to salivate .	32
lie.v.166	lie.v	lie	v	The music of Bini SalFininistas , capital LP Ab63711-r , one of the rare recordings of this titanic , yet unsung , composer . Those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the Brest-Silevniov Festival in August , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return to public notice ; ; and it is not unlikely that , even as the great Bach lay dormant for so many years , so has the erudite , ingenious SalFininistas passed through his `` purgatory '' of neglect . But now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer Marc Schlek , Jr. , a major revival is under way .	70

According to official journals published recently by Mexico 's Treasury Department , Mexico 's foreign trade in 1997 continued to grow rapidly , the total amount of imports and exports reached 220.178 billion US dollars , 18.85 % higher than that of the previous year , and within that the amount of exports was 110.380 billion US dollars , the amount of imports was 109.798 billion US dollars , 15 % and 22.7 % higher than 1996 , respectively .	28

On this trip to the South he wants , above all else , to sniff the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at least one barn burn at midnight '' . Obviously , such a Northern tourist 's purpose is somewhat akin to a child 's experience with Disneyland : he wants to see a world of make-believe .	48

Miriam sniffed at this , and complained that Wright had said unkind things about her to reporters . His reply was , `` Everything that has been printed derogatory to you , purporting to have come from me , was a betrayal , and nothing yet has been printed which I have sanctioned '' .	80

sniff.v.11	sniff.v	sniff	v	However , the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way . `` Maybe I 'm a little stuffy , but I would n't sell them , '' sniffs Bob Machon , owner of Papa 's Sports Cards in Menlo Park , Calif . `` Who knows how much they 'll be worth 100 years from now ? ''	34
sniff.v.12	sniff.v	sniff	v	Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters are n't universally loved in Hollywood but they are well connected . Their stock in trade as `` executive producers '' is sniffing out hot properties , locking them up and then getting big studios to bankroll and distribute them . Sometimes Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a `` Flashdance , '' or buy rights to a best seller such as `` The Color Purple . ''	27
sniff.v.13	sniff.v	sniff	v	The ad campaigns usually follow one of three tracks -- stressing the company 's ` Texasness , ' pointing out the competition 's lack thereof , or trying to be more Texan than Texans . Ford trucks may outsell Chevy trucks in places like `` Connecticut and Long Island , '' sniffs a commercial for Chevrolet , a division of General Motors Corp .

In the past an orthodontist might have tried , over four or five years , to straighten and fit the boy 's large teeth into a jaw that , despite some growth , would never accommodate them .

She stood up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming in or going out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in a moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests . She went into the living room and turned on three lamps , then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn , illuminating the driveway .	39
straighten.v.5	straighten.v	straighten	v	Shayne turned the handle and jerked the door open before either of the men were quite aware of his presence in the night . Geely grunted and slid partly out , and Shayne 's left arm snaked in around his neck to help him , while he set himself solidly on the roadway and swung his right fist to the big , gum-chewing jaw before Geely could straighten up . Shayne stepped back to let him slump to the ground , and then dived over him through the open door into Harris who was cursing loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder holster , somewhat impeded by the steering wheel .	67

straighten.v.8	straighten.v	straighten	v	Muller , nakedly exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a car 's headlights , threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table ; ; his face wore a look of outrage . A shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain ; ; a following volley of shots shattered glass , ripped the ceiling , and sent him lurching heavily from the table . He was dead before his body made contact with the floor .	44
straighten.v.9	straighten.v	straighten	v	Silently , Elaine picked up her keys from the table and went out into the cockpit , Poet behind her , Nick trailing behind him . She threw back a cushion over one of the seats , unlocked a padlock on the chest beneath it , then presently straightened , holding a long knife and a wicked looking spear gun in her hand . Poet whistled softly as he looked at the gun .	48

After a time , he straightened again , brushing the red Permian dust from his hands , slapping it from his six-dollar levis and his tailored , twenty-five-dollar shirt . He wore no gun -- a strange ommission for a peace officer in this country .	19
straighten.v.15	straighten.v	straighten	v	Lord slugged him in the stomach , so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine . Then , as he doubled , gasping , vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten , Lord straightened him with an uppercut . A rabbit punch redoubled him .	36

straighten.v.19	straighten.v	straighten	v	All , that is , except Jack . He hung around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened desks and put the room in order . Once -LRB- this was on the third day of school -RRB- she kneeled down to pick up some books where they 'd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress -- at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg .	23
straighten.v.20	straighten.v	straighten	v	He thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating . About that time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she did n't even see him . He jumped back , ducked and ran , crouching , down the hill away from the school .	16
straighten.v.21	straighten.v	straighten	v	`` Y 're welcome '' . He straightened himself , soldierly against the wall , and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots . His stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text .	7
straighten.v.22	straighten.v	straighten	v	He shouted at her and told her he loved her and could n't understand why she had upset herself . But now he was happy she would let him straighten out her life and take care of her . He would never let her harm herself again .	29
straighten.v.23	straighten.v	straighten	v	It dawns on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you , he was a man , and that because Gratt Shafer was making you miserable , you were passing it down to him , to Gratt Shafer 's substitute , that other guy . And you wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to St. Louis , where he got to be a big unhappy success . You wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of you .	77
straighten.v.24	straighten.v	straighten	v	Would he have to clean up after her every day , clean the kitchen , the bathroom , and get down on his knees and scrub the kitchen floor , then hang up her dresses , pick up her stockings , make the bed while she lay around ? ? He straightened up , ready to vent his exasperation , then grew afraid . If he dwelt on the indignities he suffered he would lose all respect for her , and without the respect he might lose his view of her , too .	51

pursue.v.3	pursue.v	pursue	v	The speed with which Mr. Putin seems to have responded to events here , is that any indication that perhaps he has found the whole incident embarrassing ? It may be that this is simply a case which is not important on a wider scale for Putin , that he has shown what he needed to show to the Russian public , which is that the system is there , the system is going strong , it is taking care of the state secrets and , you know , the police is doing its job , the Federal Security Service is doing its job , but now that that has been done with , now that we have had a conviction in court he does not see the necessity of pursuing the whole thing any further , and in order to appear magnanimous in the eyes of the Western public opinion , certainly , I guess that those are the reasons which prompted him to move in the direction he has moved .

As Gore considers his options with his family , advisers say he and the campaign realize they are operating on two distinct and delicate tracts -- legal , which they will pursue to keep options open , and political , which they have to watch carefully as they feel mounting pressure . Friends point out that the man who was so quick to concede the first time to George W.

A rich nation can for a time , without noticeable damage to itself , pursue a course of self-indulgence , making its single goal the material ease and comfort of its own citizens -- thus repudiating its own spiritual and material stake in a peaceful and prosperous society of nations .

So great a man could not but understand , too , that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought , which their opponents see and attack , but the truth which the latter do not see -- any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves defend .

The thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the Civil War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed .

Well , the work that we have so far in English translation suggests that , and indeed this novel , which is a celebration as well of the self of the individual , goes so far as to even divide up to the self . Characters proliferate out of the imagination of the narrator so that you have at a certain point , you have a new he , you have a new she , you have a you , and each one of these characters tells stories , each story of which is designed to give you a deeper sense of the richness and the complexity of life in China .	59

That this abandonment takes place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , is enough to associate Jacoby with art , and to bring down upon him the punishment for art ; ; that is , he is suspect , guilty , punishable , as is anyone in Mann 's stories who produces illusion , and this is true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between Jacoby and Lautner .
